According to Sammy himself, “I was in a rent-a-car that wouldn’t go much faster than 55 miles an hour…..cop stopped me for doing 62 on a four lane road when there was no one else in sight. Then the guy gave me a ticket. And he said, ‘We give tickets around here for over-60.’ and I said, ‘I can’t drive 55.’ I grabbed a paper and a pen, and I swear the guy was writing the ticket and I was writing the lyrics. I got to Lake Placid, I had a guitar set-up there. And I wrote that song there on the spot.” When the video aired on MTV it ticked off law enforcement across the country and they demanded equal TV time to show the dangers of driving fast. There is also a rumor that Hagar’s auto insurance was WAY high…$5,000 a month. I CAN’T DRIVE 55 peaked at #26 in the fall of 1984.\nQuestion:\nAccording to Sammy Haggar, what can't he drive?\nAnswer:\n",

This prevented him from playing wind instruments. It was also his excuse for giving up his priestly duties, although it did not prevent him from conducting and teaching.\n- The official cause of death was 'internal inflammation' which is rather vague and could mean any of a number of causes but was probably asthmatic bronchitis.\nLove life\n- Antonio was ordained as a catholic priest at the age of 26. This involves taking the vow of chastity. Although he gave up celebrating the Mass soon after ordination, he never renounced the priesthood, never married and remained a priest all his life.\n- Very little is known about his private life and people love to speculate. Most of his working life was involved with the girls of the Pietà orphanage for girls. There is no evidence of anything but a dedicated hard working highly productive and creative output.\n- The only 'scandal' was his attachment to the soprano Anna Giro who sang in his operas. She was 17 and he was 48 when they met. She and her sister Paolina accompanied him on his travels around Europe and they lived in his house. He insisted that they provided necessary care for him in his poor health and that there was no romantic involvement. The gossips obviously thought otherwise.\nGloria by 'Vivaldi's Women' in the Pietà church, Venice\nOne of the highlights of a stay in Venice when doing the 18th century Grand Tour was to go to the Pietà church and hear the girls singing in the choir. This wonderful video is a reconstruction of the experience.\n Flute Concerto in D, Allegro and Cantabile, (part one of two)\nPlayed by 9 year old Emma\nLute Concerto in D\nQuestion:\nWhich 18th Century composer wrote ‘The Four Seasons’?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nHigh Willhays\nHigh Willhays or, according to some authors, High Willes  is the highest point on Dartmoor, Devon, at 621 metres (2,039 ft) above sea level,Dartmoor National Park Authority, [http://web.archive.org/web/20070808234510/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/lab-geninfo.pdf General Information: Dartmoor Factsheet], 2004, p. 1 and the highest point in the United Kingdom south of the Brecon Beacons.\n\nToponymy\n\nIn 1912, William Crossing, writer and documenter, said that the name High Willes had been thought to have derived from the word huel or wheal meaning mine, but he did not think that very likely as old mine workings were invariably located near to streams. He suggested instead that the name derived from gwylfa, a watching place, noting its similarity with Brown Willy, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here. He also posited a possible link to the word gwili meaning winding or tortuous, but said it was unlikely this was where it originated from.\n\nThe Place-Names of Devon (1931) notes that the peak was named Hight Wyll in a document of 1532, and was known in 1827 as High Willows. The authors state that the name may simply be a compound of high and well (meaning spring), though they admit that the additional syllable at the end is hard to explain. \n\nTopography\n\nHigh Willhays is near the northwestern edge of Dartmoor, about 2.5 km south east of Meldon Reservoir and about 5 km south of the town of Okehampton. Although it is the highest point of the moor, it is relatively insignificant in comparison to most of the moor's tors, consisting of no more than a few low outcrops of rock along a north-south ridge. The largest outcrop is crowned with a cairn. The more impressive, but slightly lower, Yes Tor is about 1 km north along this ridge, which is known as \"the roof of Devon\".\n\nHigh Willhays and Yes Tor are the only summits in England south of Kinder Scout in the Peak District to rise above 2000 ft, apart from Black Mountain on the Welsh border. Before Ordnance Survey measured accurately the heights of High Willhays and Yes Tor many people believed Yes Tor was the higher of the two, and it was only the local farmers and moormen that believed the contrary.  However, the first topographical survey of the area carried out by Ordnance Survey suggested that High Willhays was twelve feet higher, although the difference has now been measured at just eight feet. William Crossing stated that High Willhays was the highest point in England south of Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales, but since then surveys have shown that Kinder Scout is also higher.\n\nThe geology of High Willhays, like most of Dartmoor, consists of granite intruded about 280 million years ago. However High Willhays is in an area of the northern plateau of the moor where the exposed rock has noticeably fewer of the large feldspar megacrysts that are typical of most of Dartmoor's tors.  Each of the outcrops displays lamellar bedding.\n\nHigh Willhays is within one of Dartmoor's Danger Zones, areas used periodically by the British Army for exercises. Red flags are raised around the perimeter when live-firing is due to take place.\nQuestion:\nHigh Willhays is the highest point of what National Park?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nSuidae\nSuidae is a family of artiodactyl mammals commonly called \"pigs\", hogs, or boars.  In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa Babyrousa babyrussa and the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia and its islands, to Europe, and Africa.\n\nThe earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch of Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene.  Several fossil species are known, and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodon).\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nSuids belong to the order Artiodactyla, and are generally regarded as the living members of that order most similar to the ancestral form. Unlike most other members of the order, they have four toes on each foot, although they walk only on the middle two digits, with the others staying clear of the ground. They also have a simple stomach, rather than the more complex, ruminant, stomach found in most other artiodactyl families.\n\nThey are small to medium animals, varying in size from 58 to in length, and 6 to in weight in the case of the pygmy hog, to 130 - and 100 - in the giant forest hog.  They have large heads and short necks, with relatively small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female's cervix.   \n\nSuids have a well-developed sense of hearing, and are vocal animals, communicating with a series of grunts, squeals, and similar sounds. They also have an acute sense of smell. Many species are omnivorous, eating grass, leaves, roots, insects, worms, and even frogs or mice. Other species are more selective and purely herbivorous.\n\nTheir teeth reflect their diet, and suids retain the upper incisors, which are lost in most other Artiodactyls. The canine teeth are enlarged to form prominent tusks, used for rooting in moist earth or undergrowth, and in fighting. They have only a short diastema. The number of teeth varies between species, but the general dental formula is: \n\nBehaviour and reproduction\n\nSuids are intelligent and adaptable animals. Adult females (sows) and their young travel in a group (sounder; see List of animal names), while adult males (boars) are either solitary, or travel in small bachelor groups. Males generally are not territorial, and come into conflict only during the mating season.\n\nLitter size varies between one and twelve, depending on the species. The mother prepares a grass nest or similar den, which the young leave after about ten days. Suids are weaned at around three months, and become sexually mature at 18 months. In practice, however, male suids are unlikely to gain access to sows in the wild until they have reached their full physical size, at around four years of age. In all species, the male is significantly larger than the female, and possesses more prominent tusks.\n\nClassification\n\n \nThe complete list of living species, and a partial list of extinct genera known from the fossil record,   extinct taxa marked with a dagger \"†\", are:\n\n*Suidae\n**Subfamily †Cainochoerinae\n***Genus †Albanohyus\n***Genus †Cainochoerus\n**Subfamily †Hyotheriinae\n***Genus †Aureliachoerus\n***Genus †Chicochoerus\n***Genus †Hyotherium\n***Genus †Nguruwe (formerly placed in Kubanochoerinae) \n***Genus †Xenohyus\n**Subfamily †Listriodontinae \n***Tribe †Kubanochoerini\n****Genus †Kubanochoerus (junior synonyms Libycochoerus, Megalochoerus)\n***Tribe †Listriodontini\n****Genus †Eurolistriodon\n****Genus †Listriodon (junior synonym Bunolistriodon)\n***Tribe †Namachoerini\n****Genus †Lopholistriodon\n****Genus †Namachoerus\n***Tribe incertae sedis\n****Genus †Dicoryphochoerus\n**Subfamily Suinae\n***Tribe Babyrousini\n****Genus Babyrousa (Pleistocene to recent)\n*****Species B. babyrussa Buru babirusa\n*****Species †B. bolabatuensis Bola Batu babirusa\n*****Species Babyrousa celebensis North Sulawesi babirusa\n*****Species Babyrousa togeanensis Togian babirusa\n***Tribe †Hippohyini\n****Genus †Hippohyus (Miocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus †Sinohyus (Miocene)\n****Genus †Sivahyus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n***Tribe Potamochoerini\n****Genus †Celebochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus Hylochoerus (Pleistocene to recent)\n*****Species Hylochoerus meinertzhageni giant forest hog\n****Genus †Kolpochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene) (junior synonyms Ectopotamochoerus, Mesochoerus, Omochoerus, Promesochoerus)\n****Genus Potamochoerus (Miocene to recent)\n*****Species P. larvatus bushpig\n*****Species P. porcus red river hog\n****Genus †Propotamochoerus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n***Tribe Suini\n****Genus †Eumaiochoerus (Miocene)\n****Genus †Hippopotamodon (Miocene to Pleistocene)  (junior synonym Limnostonyx)\n****Genus †Korynochoerus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n****Genus †Microstonyx (Miocene)\n****Genus Sus (Miocene to recent)\n*****Species S. ahoenobarbus Palawan bearded pig\n*****Species S. barbatus Bornean bearded pig\n*****Species S. bucculentus Heude's pig or Vietnamese warty pig\n*****Species S. cebifrons Visayan warty pig\n*****Species S. celebensis Celebes warty pig\n*****Species S. heureni Flores warty pig\n*****Species S. oliveri Mindoro warty pig\n*****Species S. philippensis Philippine warty pig\n*****Species S. scrofa (also called S. domesticus) domestic pig, wild boar\n*****Species S. verrucosus Java warty pig\n*****Species †S. strozzi\n***Tribe Phacochoerini\n****Genus †Metridiochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus Phacochoerus (Pliocene to recent)\n*****Species P. aethiopicus Cape, Somali or desert warthog\n*****Species P. africanus common warthog\n****Genus †Potamochoeroides (Pliocene, possibly Pleistocene)\n****Genus †Stylochoerus (Pleistocene)\n***Tribe incertae sedis  \n****Genus Porcula\n*****Species P. salvania pygmy hog\n** Subfamily †Tetraconodontinae\n*** Genus †Conohyus\n*** Genus †Notochoerus\n*** Genus †Nyanzachoerus\n*** Genus †Parachleuastochoerus\n*** Genus †Sivachoerus\n*** Genus †Tetraconodon (Miocene, Myanmar)  \n****Species †T. intermedius\n****Species †T. malensis\n****Species †T. minor\n**Subfamily incertae sedis\n***Genus †Chleuastochoerus\n***Genus †Hemichoerus\n***Genus †Hyosus\n***Genus †Kenyasus (formerly placed in Kubanochoerinae)\n***Genus †Schizochoerus\n***Genus †Sinapriculus\nQuestion:\nArtiodactyla Suidae is the scientific name for which farm animal?\nAnswer:\n",

Premature complete ossification of the sutures is called craniosynostosis.\n\nDuring infancy, the anterior fontanelle is known as the bregma.\n\nStructure\n\nThe skull of a newborn consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth.\n\n* Posterior fontanelle is triangle-shaped. It lies at the junction between the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture. At birth, the skull features a small posterior fontanelle with an open area covered by a tough membrane, where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone (at the lambda). The posterior fontanelles ossify within 2 or 3 months of birth. This is called intramembranous ossification.  The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue.\n* Anterior fontanelle is a diamond-shaped membrane-filled space located between the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull. It persists until approximately 18 months after birth. It is at the junction of the coronal suture and sagittal suture. The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months. In cleidocranial dysostosis, however, it is often late in closing or may never close.  Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle.\n* Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head, more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bones) and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).\nDuring birth, fontanelles enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal. The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 9 to 18 months.  The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles, the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant.\n\nClosure\n\nIn humans, the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows:\n# The posterior fontanelle generally closes 8–12 weeks after birth;\n# The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth;\n# The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after birth; and\n# The anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 12–18 months.\n\nClinical significance\n\nThe fontanelle may pulsate, and although the precise cause of this is not known, it is perfectly normal and seems to echo the heartbeat, perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature, or in the meninges. This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name – fontanelle is borrowed from the old French word fontenele, which is a diminutive of fontaine, meaning \"spring\". It is assumed that the term spring is used because of the analogy of the dent in a rock or earth where a spring arises. \n\nParents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles. In fact, although they may colloquially be called \"soft-spots\", the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate.\n\nFontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using ultrasonography. Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.\n\nDisease\n\nFontanelles – bulging\n\nA very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally.  It can occur due to:\n* Encephalitis – swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections\n* Hydrocephalus – a buildup of fluid inside the skull\n* Meningitis—infection of the membranes covering the brain\n\nFontanelles – sunken\n\nA sunken (also called \"depressed\") fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition. \n\nFontanelles – enlarged\n\nThe fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like: \n* Down syndrome\n* Hydrocephalus\n* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n* Premature birth\n\nRarer causes include:\n* Achondroplasia\n* Apert syndrome\n* Cleidocranial dysostosis\n* Congenital rubella\n* Neonatal hypothyroidism\n* Osteogenesis imperfecta\n* Rickets\n\nIn other animals\n\nIn apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.\n\nIn dogs\n\nNot all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.\n\nAdditional images\n\n File:Fontanelle.png|Fontanelle.\n File:Anterior fontanelle.jpg|Anterior fontanelle.\n File:Sutures from top.png|Cranial sutures shown from top of head.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the soft spots on a baby's head which, during birth, enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal?\nAnswer:\n",

A school with mind, heart, guts and a constant fizz.\"\nGood Schools Guide 2016\nWhen you make your first visit to Wellington College you immediately get a sense that it is more than just a school. The beautiful grounds and breath-taking buildings see to that, as does the palpable sense of purpose among every pupil and member of staff you meet. I genuinely do not believe that there is a better coeducational boarding and day school for 13 – 18 year olds in the land.\nThe College, founded in 1853 as a living memorial to the Duke of Wellington, sought to deliver an inspirational education for all of its pupils. As the school grew, so too did the identity of those pupils. It is an identity built on intellectual curiosity, on true independence, on a generous and far-reaching inclusivity and on the courage to be properly and unselfishly individual. It is, in short, the capacity to be inspired to become the very best you can be. And it is these qualities that are present in the thousands of small interactions that happen all the time here, the little daily miracles that make this such a special place. After all, the school we build is the school we build together, and every pupil who passes through Wellington leaves an indelible mark on our community. It is my absolute responsibility to help all our pupils become the very best that they can be, and to develop the identity that marks them out as a true Wellingtonian.\nWellington College is set in 400 acres of beautiful parkland in leafy Berkshire, one hour from Central London and just 40 minutes from Heathrow. Please do explore our on-line tour to get a sense of the scope and size of the school, for our campus is quite simply stunning. Wellington’s curriculum is vibrant, demanding and progressive, and with our ground-breaking Wellbeing course and classes in Philosophy and Thinking, Wellington has become nationally renowned as a centre for curriculum development. Our stunning examination results and university outcomes speak for themselves.\nCreativity flourishes and it was no surprise when the Arts Council awarded us Artsmark Gold in recognition of the outstanding provision and standards across all the Arts at the school. We have a “premier league” reputation as one of the best schools for sport in the UK and, in recent years, our teams have achieved national renown and titles in hockey, rugby, golf, shooting, triathlon, squash, equestrianism, cricket, rackets and polo. Outward-facing in all that we do, the College’s focus on service, leadership and character education means that Wellingtonians leave the school fully prepared for the challenges of adult life in the 21st Century.\nRT @WillGreenwood: Mia!!! Awesomeness!!! http://EPg3ox7z9g\n@Welly_Master | 18 January 2017\nChoice lies at the heart of our co-curriculum and is central to developing the Wellington Identity which ensures that all our pupils are Inspired, Intellectual, Independent, Individual and Inclusive. Our pupils and our staff see every day as an opportunity, a chance to grow and a chance to learn and the journey as a life-long learner begins the moment a child starts at Wellington.\nWill you let your child join us on that journey? It could be the most inspired choice you ever make.\nJulian Thomas – 14th Master of Wellington College\nQuestion:\nIn which county is Wellington College?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nThe Underworld - Greek Mythology\nThe Underworld\nThe Underworld\nSee More The Underworld Pictures >\nThe Underworld was hidden deep in the earth and was the kingdom of the dead, ruled by god Hades . Hades was a greedy god, whose sole purpose was to increase the number of souls in his kingdom; at the same time, he was very reluctant to let any soul leave. The Erinnyes were welcomed in the Underworld.\nFor most souls, life in the underworld was not particularly unpleasant. It was rather like being in a miserable dream, full of shadows, ill-lit and desolate, barren of hope; a joyless place where the dead slowly faded into nothingness.\nGeographically, the Underworld was considered to have been surrounded by five rivers: the Acheron (river of woe), the Cocytus (river of lamentation), the Phlegethon (river of fire), the Styx (river of unbreakable oath by which the gods took vows), and the Lethe (river of forgetfulness). Past the rivers, a diamond gate, guarded by Cerberus , formed the entrance to the kingdom. Deep within the kingdom, lay Hades ' vast palace, full with guests.\nUpon death, a soul was led by Hermes near the entrance of the underworld , where the ferry awaited to carry it across the Acheron. There was a single ferry run by Charon, the boatman who took the souls across the river. Only those who could pay the fare with coins placed on their lips when buried, were granted passage; the rest were trapped between two worlds. After the boat ride, the souls entered through the gates; Cerberus allowed everyone to enter, but none to leave. The souls then appeared before a panel of three judges, Rhadamanthus , Minos , and Aeacus , who passed sentence based on their deeds during their previous life. The souls who were good went to the Elysian Fields, while the others were singled out for special treatment; Sisyphus and Tantalus are two examples of souls that were sentenced to be tormented for eternity.\nQuestion:\nIn Greek mythology, where do righteous souls go after death?\nAnswer:\n",

Bushman, Fred Niblo: Movies & TV\nBy CEN-SF on June 12, 2015\nFormat: DVD|Verified Purchase\nâBen Hurâ the movie is everything youâve heard: epic, massively entertaining, highly innovative, and an absolute must-see film.  This disc of âBen Hurâ is another matter altogether.  I focus here on the disc.\nPLUSES:  It is the full-length film and, significantly, the Technicolor scenes are intact and in color.\nMINUSES:  This disc is of Korean manufacture.  The disc itself was fine, but someone has inserted a bright blue logo on top of the black and white film; it persists throughout the credits, and bizarrely reappears for no apparent reason during one scene.  As the only color element in those sequences, it is distracting.  I have no idea whose logo it is.  Perhaps more significantly, there are visual artifacts during fast-action scenes.  These take the form of horizontal banding that looks like rasterization.  Whatever the cause, the defect looks digital, not optical.  And in a film whose glory lies in no small part on action scenes, this is a major flaw.\nNITS:  On the case cover, the movie title is mistranslated as âBen Hur: A Tales of Christ.â  No the cover doesnât really hurt anything, and the titles within the movie are the original Hollywood slides, so theyâre fine.  But for a full-price disc, this obvious error seems cheap.\nALTERNATIVES:  Amazon hypes this disc by saying ânot available in the US.â  Not quite.  This silent version is included as an extra on the Blu-ray 4-disc boxed set of the 1959 remake, which is pricey.  I also have seen a regular DVD 4-disc set that includes the silent version in its extras as well, for a more reasonable cost.  (I do not think the silent version is included with the Blu-ray 2-disc set.)  I canât speak personally to the quality of these transfers, but I have to imagine youâd at least not have the looming logo thatâs present on the Korean disc.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:  Magnificent movie, see it.  This is a very tatty disc for full priceâ¦hold out for a better version.\nBy Andre M. on December 2, 2016\nFormat: DVD|Verified Purchase\nThose who may dislike silent films may change their minds after seeing this one.\nThis retelling of the classic novel is actually the second, not fist filmed version as commonly believed (the original was a crude early silent from 1907 that is of historical interest only). This version is a well told drama full of thrills and excitement about the Jewish wealthy heir who faces treachery from his childhood friend and forced into slavery. Much has been said about the story, but it is really well told here. Great acting, chariot races, ship battles, and even a few scenes in early technicolor. In some ways, it precedes KING OF KINGS two years later in 1927 with the color scenes, high production quality, and the Jesus Christ aspects. It is so exciting and well done that as is the case with KING OF KINGS, it may convert haters of silent cinema into fans of the genre.\nBy Louise Madeline on June 10, 2013\nFormat: DVD|Verified Purchase\nMesmerizing!  This may be a silent film, but as with all silent films there is an amazing quality that draws you deeper into the visual and dramatic spectacular of this tale.  If you're even the least religious or searching this film will definitely impact your life.  Not \"true\" black and white in that there is a sepia that lends a vintage look to the frames, which is not as drawing on the eyes.  The clarity of this film is unbelievably sharp.  It's as though it were made yesterday.  Very much worth purchasing.\nBy NHMovieLover on January 16, 2014\nFormat: DVD|Verified Purchase\nI have always enjoyed the story of Ben Hur. I enjoy the Charlton Heston version and being a Ramon Navarro fan I wanted to take a chance and see how I would enjoy this silent. I have never been a fan of the Silent films but I have to say I really enjoyed this one. It was amazing to see what the fuss was about. This movie was amazing. It really pulled me in and I found myself really enjoying it. If you are a fan of silent Films or even Ramon Navarro, you may want to take a look at this gem. To think it will soon be 100 years old in 12 more years.\nQuestion:\nA novel by General Lew Wallace published in 1880 was made into which films in 1926 (a silent movie) and 1959 (produced by William Wyler)?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nDeath to Spies\nReleased in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games. The game was released on Valve's digital distribution system, Steam, on March 12, 2008.\n\nGameplay\n\nDeath to Spies takes place from a third-person perspective. The player controls Semion Strogov, a captain in a Soviet counterintelligence agency named SMERSH. Strogov is able to run, jump, crouch, crawl and climb over obstacles, and he is also able to drive vehicles. Taking place in World War II, the player is required to complete various tasks in enemy territory, such as killing targets and stealing documents. Emphasis is placed on stealth, as the player is greatly outnumbered by enemy personnel, and some missions will be failed if the alarm is raised. \n\nThe game's missions are connected by cutscenes, taking place in 1951. After the arrest of the head of SMERSH Viktor Abakumov, Semion Strogov is questioned about his involvement in a number of special operations between 1943 through 1946, as his interrogators search for any connections between him and Abakumov.\n\nThe Heads-up display shows the level of awareness and suspicion of enemies, both of which are represented with a single bar at the top of the screen and are represented separately as different icons. A vector map can be displayed on the screen, showing characters' locations and their fields of vision, in which the player will be detected either instantly or gradually, depending on the distance. The vector map also shows the radius of noises made by the player; if someone is within the radius of the noise, they may investigate the noise or become alerted, depending on the noise.\n\nDisguises can be used to avoid alerting enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes picking the lock of a door or looking through a door's keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.\n\nBefore starting a mission, the player is usually able to select equipment to bring to the mission. Strogov has a carrying capacity limited to one handgun, one long gun and 18 slots for small items such as ammunition and knives; one knife can also be stored in a dedicated slot. A backpack has space for larger items such as pliers and dynamite, and space for small items, but Strogov also has a weight limit to his inventory, and small items stored in a backpack must be moved to the 18 slots before it can be used.\nA variety of firearms (along with ammunition) and explosives are available to choose from, with the choices available depending on the mission. Other weapons include chloroform, knives, a garrote and poison. German equipment can also be chosen to avoid suspicion from enemy personnel when in disguise and/or to make use of ammunition taken from enemies' bodies.\n\nSeveral missions take place in allied areas. The player is forced to begin these missions lightly armed and they cannot select their equipment. However, weapons and ammunition can be found in the level.\n\nReception\n\nDeath to Spies mostly received above average reviews. The game has an average score of 70% on Game Rankings  and 69% on Metacritic.  GameSpot gave it a 7.0, praising its detailed level design variation and challenging missions, but at the same time noting that the game can be overly difficult at times. IGN gave it an 8.0, saying it was \"horrifically difficult at times and not without its peculiarities; Death to Spies is nevertheless always interesting and wholly addictive.\" \n\nSequel\n\nOn March 23, 2009 1C Company announced a sequel, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.  It was released on August 10, 2009.\nQuestion:\nWhich counter-intelligence agency had a name meaning ‘death to spies’ in English?\nAnswer:\n",

His family descended from the Clan MacLaren in Argyll.\n\nDesign engineer\n\nSpitfire undercarriage\n\nHe invented the Spitfire undercarriage when living in West Drayton, Middlesex when working for Maclaren Undercarriage Company Ltd. The design allowed aircraft to be steered or swivelled whilst on the ground. He retired from aeronautical design in 1944, forming the company Andrews Maclaren and making aircraft components.\n\nCollapsible baby buggy\n\nThe former test pilot and designer of the Supermarine Spitfire undercarriage was inspired when his daughter visited from the United States with his first grandchild.  After watching the parents struggle with the clumsy conventional pushchair, he used his knowledge of lightweight, collapsible structures to create a new generation of infant transport and inspire the design of future collapsible objects such as the Strida bicycle. \n\nHe designed his first buggy in 1965, which was built in his medieval farmhouse stables in Barby, Northamptonshire in England just south of Rugby. He applied for a patent, on 20 July 1965, for his 6lb B01 prototype with lightweight aluminium tubes receiving Patent No. 1,154,362. On 18 July 1966 he filed for an American patent, receiving Patent No. 3,390,893.\n\nOnly after this design would aluminium tubes be used in other household equipment. The buggy went on sale in 1967. He also designed the 'Gadabout folding chair' which was produced from 1961, and was commissioned by the Ministry of Health to design a larger folding buggy for larger children with disabilities called the 'Buggy Major' this buggy was designed on square tubes instead of the usual round tubes like the 'Baby Buggy', being produced around 1970.  \n\nToday the modern version of the 'Baby Buggy' are sold in over 50 countries under the Maclaren brand based in Long Buckby.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe was married to Marie and they had a son and daughter.\n\nIn January 1978 Queen Elizabeth II awarded him with an MBE in the New Year's Honours List.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nIn the late 60s Owen Finlay MacLaren pioneered what useful item for parents of small chldren?\nAnswer:\n",

He made his stage debut at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1922 and soon achieved renown through his work with the Old Vic company. Noted for his remarkable versatility and striking features, he enjoyed universal admiration for his work in the classics, in modern realistic plays, and in comedy. His films include Wuthering Heights (1939), Rebecca (1940), Pride and Prejudice (1940), Henry V (1944), Richard III (1956), The Entertainer (1960), Othello (1965), and Three Sisters (1970). In 1948 he won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Hamlet in the film that he also produced and directed. In 1962, Olivier was appointed director of the National Theatre of England, which became one of the finest repertory companies in the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was a highly prized character actor, appearing in such roles as the Nazi villain in The Marathon Man (1976). Olivier was knighted in 1947 and in 1970 was made a life peer, the first actor to be so honored.\nOlivier often costarred on stage and screen with his second wife, Vivien Leigh, 1913–67, a delicate brunette who made a spectacular American film debut in Gone with the Wind (1939), winning the Academy Award. She followed this with Waterloo Bridge (1940), Lady Hamilton (with Olivier as Nelson, 1941), and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), for which she won a second Academy Award.\nSee F.

Triple sec or orange liqueur (or Grand Marnier or Cointreau, both orange liqueurs) is widely used in many classics, so we made own special version.\nWhat does triple sec taste like? Triple sec is a sweet orange citrus liqueur. Our homemade triple sec tastes heavily of oranges and orange peel, like orange hard candy. Some triple secs are not as potently orange tasting.\nThis recipe comes from Charlie Hodges at the Ace Hotel, Palm Springs, via Imbibe Magazine‘s Fall 2009 issue. Read through the steps and you’ll see that you can multitask to speed up the process.\nHere’s what you need to make triple sec:\n4 small navel oranges\n12 oz. Everclear grain alcohol\n12 oz. vodka\n12 oz. can of Mandarin orange slices\n5 cups cane sugar\nOrange blossom water\nGet all your triple sec ingredients together, then:\nHeat oven to lowest temperature setting, generally around 180ºF – 200ºF. Slice the oranges into 1/8″ thick wheels and lay out on a baking tray. Bake oranges until sticky and gummy but not dried, about 1-2 hours.\nDrain the can of Mandarin oranges and place in a jar with the vodka to infuse for about 24 hours or until it tastes strongly of the oranges.\nCombine the baked orange slices with the Everclear and infuse for 8 hours, stirring occasionally.\nMake the simple syrup combining the sugar and water and stirring over medium heat until dissolved.\nFinally, strain all liquid ingredients through a fine sieve and combine with the syrup. Stir and add a few dashes of orange blossom water to taste. Bottle it up and it keeps refrigerated for about a month.\nReady to mix?

It is named after James Parkinson, who, in 1817, wrote a classic essay on “shaking palsy” a disease whose cause is still unknown.\n1. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease.\n2. The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease increases with age, with the peak onset in the 70s and is more common in men by a ratio of 3:2\n3. Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease do not occur until 80% of neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. The substantia nigra is located in the midbrain and controls voluntary movement, produces dopamine, and regulates moods.  The dopamine cells begin to die therefore messages from the brain to the body are decreased and leave the person unable to control movements normally.\n4. The classic manifestations of Parkinson’s disease often include tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are often called the triad.\nA. Tremor, often the first sign may be minimal initially therefore the patient is the only one who notices it. The tremor can affect handwriting and is described as “pill rolling” because the thumb and forefinger appear to move in a rotary fashion as if rolling a pill.\nB. Rigidity, the second sign, is the increased resistance to passive motion when the limbs are moved through their range of motion. The rigidity is caused by sustained muscle contraction and elicits a complaint of muscle soreness; feeling tired and achy; pain in the head, upper body, spine, or legs.\nC. Bradykinesia, the final sign of the triad is particularly evident in the loss of automatic movements. They include blinking of the eyelids, swinging of the arms while walking, swallowing of saliva, self expression with facial and hand movements, and minor movement of postural adjustment.\n5.   Genetic factors associated with Parkinson’s disease include 13 genes; environmental factors include exposures\nto chemicals such as carbon monoxide and manganese; and the use of illicit drugs such as amphetamine and methamphetamine can also cause Parkinson’s disease.\n6.  Exercise can limit decreased mobility, such as muscle atrophy, contractures, and constipation. The American Parkinson Disease Association publishes booklets and videotapes that provide helpful exercises. A physical therapist or occupational therapist may be consulted to design a personal exercise program for the patient. Exercise will not halt the progress but will enhance the patient’s functional ability.\n7. Diet is a major importance to patients with Parkinson’s disease because malnutrition and constipation can be serious consequences of inadequate nutrition. Patients should eat foods that are easily chewed and swallowed and should allow\nthemselves ample time for eating to avoid frustration and encourage independence. Patients are advised to limit their protein intake if they are on levodopa.\n8. Parkinson’s can be treated with drug therapy that aims at correcting an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. Each patient must be evaluated to determine which medication is best for them. Some drug classes\ninclude; Dopamine Agonists, Anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors and Carbidopa/Levodopa. Levodopa is the most effective and is being used in 70 to 80 percent of all Parkinson’s patients.\n9.  Parkinson’s disease can be treated surgically through deep brain stimulation (DBS). This involves placing an electrode in the thalamus, globus pallidus, or subthalamic nucleus and connecting it to a generator placed in the upper chest. The device delivers a specific current to the brain to improve motor function. This procedure is reversible if needed.\n10. Parkinson’s disease interesting opinions: Adolf Hitler is said to have had the disease, people who smoke and drink are less likely to develop the disease, and Japan is the only country in the world that has more women than men with Parkinson’s disease.\nReferences\nPDF founder William Black.

    "input": "Passage:\nBirdman of Alcatraz (film)\nBirdman of Alcatraz is a 1962 film starring Burt Lancaster and directed by John Frankenheimer.   It is a largely fictionalized version of the life of Robert Stroud, a federal prison inmate known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" because of his life with birds. In spite of the title, much of the action is set at Leavenworth Prison, where Stroud was jailed with his birds. When moved to Alcatraz he was not allowed to keep any pets. \n\nThe film was adapted by Guy Trosper from the 1955 book by Thomas E. Gaddis. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Burt Lancaster), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Telly Savalas), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Thelma Ritter) and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White. \n\nPlot\n\nRobert Stroud (Lancaster) is imprisoned as a young man for committing a murder in Alaska. He is shown as a rebellious inmate, fighting against a rigid prison system: on his way to jail by train he breaks open the window to allow the suffocating inmates to breathe. His rebellious attitude puts him in conflict with Harvey Shoemaker (Malden), the warden of Leavenworth Prison.\n\nWhile in jail, Stroud learns that his mother (Ritter) tried to visit him but was denied and told to return later in the week. Outraged, he attacks a guard over the issue and the man is killed. Stroud is sentenced to death, but his mother runs a successful campaign and it is commuted to life in prison. The terms of the sentence require that he be kept in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.\n\nTo break the monotony, Stroud adopts an orphaned baby sparrow as a pet. This starts a trend and he and the other convicts acquire birds, such as canaries, as gifts from the outside. Before long, Stroud has built up a collection of birds and cages. When they fall ill, he conducts experiments and comes up with a cure. As the years pass, Stroud becomes an expert on bird diseases and even publishes a book on the subject. His writings are so impressive that a doctor describes him as a \"genius\".\n\nStroud later meets bird-lover Stella Johnson (Field) and agrees to go into business, marketing his bird remedies. He and Stella later marry, but his mother disapproves and this causes a rift between mother and son. He is abruptly transferred to the federal penitentiary at Alcatraz (the \"Rock\"), a new maximum security institution where he is not permitted to keep birds. He is now growing elderly but still shows a rebellious side, writing a history of the U.S. penal system that is suppressed by Shoemaker, now warden of the Rock.\n\nStill at odds with authority, Stroud nevertheless manages to help stop a prison rebellion in 1946 by throwing out the guns acquired by the convicts. He then assures the authorities that they can now re-enter the premises without fear of being shot. Although Stroud has been a thorn in his side for decades, Shoemaker acknowledges that he has never lied to him and takes him at his word.\n\nAlthough constantly denied parole, Stroud is eventually transferred to another prison in Missouri after a petition campaign. During the move, he meets several reporters and displays a range of knowledge on more than just birds, such as the technical details of a passing jet aircraft. He even gets to meet Thomas E. Gaddis (Edmond O'Brien), the author of the book based on his life.\n\nCast\n\n* Burt Lancaster as Robert Stroud\n* Karl Malden as Harvey Shoemaker\n* Thelma Ritter as Elizabeth McCartney Stroud\n* Neville Brand as Bull Ransom\n* Betty Field as Stella Johnson\n* Telly Savalas as Feto Gomez\n* Edmond O'Brien as Thomas E. Gaddis\n* Hugh Marlowe as Albert Comstock\n* Whit Bissell as Dr. Ellis\n* Crahan Denton as Kramer\n* James Westerfield as Jess Younger\n\nProduction\n\nThis was to have been the American film debut for British director Charles Crichton until he clashed with Lancaster and was replaced by Frankenheimer.   According to Strother Martin, \"I had a nice role in Birdman of Alcatraz.  They fired the original director, Charles Crichton, and I went out with him.  I was replaced by Leo Penn who was eventually cut out of the picture entirely.\" \n\nReception\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 82% of 17 surveyed critics, both contemporaneous and modern, gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10.   In discussing the film's prison setting, Variety wrote, \"Birdman reverses the formula and brings a new breadth and depth to the form.\"  A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called it \"a thoughtful yet powerful portrait that cleaves to the heart and mind despite its omissions\".  According to those who knew him while he was in prison, the mild-mannered characterization of Stroud, as presented in Gaddis' book and the subsequent film, was largely fiction. Former inmate Glenn Williams went so far as to say that Stroud \"was not a sweetheart; he was a vicious killer. I think Burt Lancaster owes us all an apology\".  He and another former convict, Jim Quillan, described the real Stroud as a \"jerk\", \"a guy that liked chaos and turmoil and upheaval... Always at somebody else's expense\". They regarded the film as a \"comedy... an excellent comedy\". The film was placed at #76 on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the 'Birdman of Alcatraz'?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nZadok the Priest\nThe four anthems The King Shall Rejoice, My Heart is Inditing, Let thy Hand be Strengthened, and Zadok the Priest were composed by George Frideric Handel for the coronation of King George II in 1727, and are thus known as the Coronation Anthems. Zadok the Priest has been sung during the anointing of the sovereign at every Coronation of the British monarch since 1727.\n\nText\n\nPart of the traditional content of British coronations, the texts for all four anthems were picked by Handel—a personal selection from the most accessible account of an earlier coronation, that of James II in 1685.  The text is a translation of the traditional antiphon, Unxerunt Salomonem,  itself derived from the biblical account of the anointing of Solomon. These words have been used in every English, and later British, coronation since that of King Edgar at Bath Abbey in 973. An earlier setting had been written by Henry Lawes for the coronation of King Charles II. \n\nAt the coronation itself on 11 October 1727, the choir of Westminster Abbey sang Zadok the Priest in the wrong part of the service; they had earlier entirely forgotten to sing one anthem and another ended \"in confusion\". \n\nFull text\n\nAfter 1 Kings 1:38–40\n\nZadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet anointed Solomon King.\nAnd all the people rejoiced, and said:\nGod save the King! Long live the King!\nMay the King live for ever,\nAmen, Allelujah.\n\nStructure\n\nZadok the Priest is written for SS-AA-T-BB chorus and orchestra (two oboes, two bassoons, three trumpets, timpani, strings (with three violin parts rather than the usual two), continuo). The music prepares a surprise in its orchestral introduction through the use of static layering of soft string textures followed by a sudden rousing forte tutti entrance, augmented by three trumpets.\n\nThe middle section \"And all the people rejoic'd, and said\" is an imitatory dance in 3/4 time, with the choir singing chordally and a dotted rhythm in the strings.\n\nThe final section \"God save the King\", etc. is a return to common time (4/4), with the \"God save the King\" section heard chordally, interspersed with the Amens incorporating long semiquaver runs, taken in turn through the six voice parts (SAATBB) with the other parts singing quaver chords accompanying it. The chorus ends with a largo plagal cadence on \"Allelujah\".\n\nOther uses\n\n* It is regularly (sometimes daily) played by request on 'popular classics' radio stations in the United Kingdom such as Classic FM, which aired this song at its launch at 6am on 7 September 1992.\n* Used in royal weddings, including that of Mary Elizabeth Donaldson to Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark. \n*Used in a 2015 commercial for DirectTV advertising a partnership with AT&T to watch TV on mobile phones. \n* Furthermore Tony Britten rearranged Zadok the Priest in 1992. Since then this rearrangement is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the coronation anthem composed by Handel using texts from the King James Bible that has been sung at every British coronation service since 1727?\nAnswer:\n",

Ray Bradbury did an excellent job adapting the dialogue and exposition from the novel for the film. he took giant and important chunks of essential dialogue, without needing to take up the extraneous scientific jargon or soliliqiues that are better suited for the printed page than the screen. He remains faithful to Melville's vision, and the important symbolism is there. It's a very difficult job, and Melville's novel is a very difficult book to adapt, but Bradbury, who apparently hadn't read the book before adapting it, did one hell of a job.\nThe actors are great, and it's a shame they didn't win any Oscars. Gregory Peck is excellent as the sullen, vengeance-driven Captain Aheab. He made the role his own, and knew when to be passionate and when to be calm and quiet. Some parts of the novel may seem wordy to viewers, but are important in conveying Melville's meaning, such as Father Mapple's sermon on man's obedience to God. If you have a short attention span, and only like action films that are short on substance, this movie is not for you. Everyone else must do themselves a favor and watch this classic. This is an adaptation for the ages.\n7 of 8 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nQuestion:\nIn which classic novel does the character Queequeg appear?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage is a lengthy narrative poem in four parts written by Lord Byron. It was published between 1812 and 1818 and is dedicated to \"Ianthe\". The poem describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary young man who, disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry, looks for distraction in foreign lands. In a wider sense, it is an expression of the melancholy and disillusionment felt by a generation weary of the wars of the post-Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The title comes from the term childe, a medieval title for a young man who was a candidate for knighthood.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe poem contains elements thought to be autobiographical, as Byron generated some of the storyline from experience gained during his travels through Portugal, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea between 1809 and 1811.. The \"Ianthe\" of the dedication was the term of endearment he used for Lady Charlotte Harley, about 11 years old when  Childe Harold was first published. Charlotte Bacon née Harley was the second daughter of 5th Earl of Oxford and Lady Oxford, Jane Elizabeth Scott. Throughout the poem Byron, in character of Childe Harold, regretted his wasted early youth, hence re-evaluating his life choices and re-designing himself through going on the pilgrimage, during which he lamented on various historical events including the Iberian Peninsular War among others.\n\nDespite Byron's initial hesitation at having the first two cantos of the poem published because he felt it revealed too much of himself,  it was published, at the urging of friends, by John Murray in 1812, and brought both the poem and its author to immediate and unexpected public attention. Byron later wrote, \"I awoke one morning and found myself famous\".  The first two cantos in John Murray's edition were illustrated by Richard Westall, well-known painter and illustrator who was then commissioned to paint portraits of Byron.\n\nByronic hero\n\nThe work provided the first example of the Byronic hero.  The idea of the Byronic hero is one that consists of many different characteristics. The hero must have a rather high level of intelligence and perception as well as be able to easily adapt to new situations and use cunning to his own gain. It is clear from this description that this hero is well-educated and by extension is rather sophisticated in his style. Aside from the obvious charm and attractiveness that this automatically creates, he struggles with his integrity, being prone to mood swings. Generally, the hero has a disrespect for certain figures of authority, thus creating the image of the Byronic hero as an exile or an outcast. The hero also has a tendency to be arrogant and cynical, indulging in self-destructive behaviour which leads to the need to seduce women. Although his sexual attraction through being mysterious is rather helpful, it often gets the hero into trouble. Characters with the qualities of the Byronic hero have appeared in novels, films and plays ever since.\n\nStructure\n\nThe poem has four cantos written in Spenserian stanzas, which consist of eight iambic pentameter lines followed by one alexandrine (a twelve syllable iambic line), and has rhyme pattern ABABBCBCC.\n\nInterpretations\n\nChilde Harold became a vehicle for Byron's own beliefs and ideas, but in the preface to canto four Byron complains that his readers conflate him and Child Harold too much, so he will not speak of Harold as much in the final canto. According to Jerome McGann, by masking himself behind a literary artifice, Byron was able to express his view that \"man's greatest tragedy is that he can conceive of a perfection which he cannot attain\". \n\nCultural references\n\nThe poem's protagonist is referenced several times in description of the eponymous hero in Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin.\n\nParts of it have been quoted towards the end of Asterix in Belgium and the 2000 film Britannic.\n\nHector Berlioz drew inspiration from this poem in the creation of his second symphony, a programmatic and arguably semi-autobiographical work called Harold en Italie.\n\nIn Anthony Trollope's third book of his Palliser novels, The Eustace Diamonds, Rev. Emilius read the first half of the fourth canto of this poem to Lizzie Eustace.\nQuestion:\nWhich lengthy narrative poem by Lord Byron describes the trials and reflections of a world weary young man?\nAnswer:\n",

The population at the 2011 Census was 187. \n\nSwarkestone has a very old village church, a full cricket pitch, a plant nursery/ garden centre and restaurant called \"Swarkestone Nursery\", the Crewe and Harpur pub, a canal with locks and moorings. It was mentioned twice in Domesday as Sorchestun or Suerchestune, when it was worth twenty shillings.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. ISBN 0-14-143994-7 p.742 & 749\n\nSwarkstone Bridge\n\nThe ancient bridge at Swarkestone crosses the River Trent about 6 miles south of Derby and was for about 300 years the Midlands' main crossing of the Trent. The only crossing between Burton Upon Trent and Nottingham, it is currently Grade I Listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nHistory\n\nSwarkestone bridge was built in the 13th century to cross the river and its surrounding marshes, between the villages of Swarkstone and Stanton by Bridge.[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid\n1088337 Swarkestone Bridge and Causeway], English Heritage, retrieved 7 September 2014 It was financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiances, however, had to meet the local barons on the far side of the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen; eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback: both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that no one else would suffer the tragedy they had. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.\n\nSwarkstone bridge is three quarters of a mile long and has 17 arches. It is the longest stone bridge in England, and the longest inland bridge in England.\n\nIn 1745, Swarkstone Bridge was the furthest point South Bonny Prince Charlie, and his troops, got in his attempt to reclaim the British Throne.\n\nAccording to Pevsner, the present part actually crossing the river, which has 5 arches, dates from the 18th century and was designed by Thomas Harrison.  Substantial work was carried out in 1795–1797 by Thomas Sykes, County Surveyor of Bridges for Derbyshire, at a cost of  £3,550.\n\nThe Bridge Today\n\nThe bridge is undersized for modern traffic and is scarcely two-lane for cars at several points. Though there is a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes, the walls of the bridge often take damage from traffic.\n\nLocal Legends\n\nThe bridge is subject to several local legends. It is supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of the two Bellamont Sisters that constructed the bridge. Others have alleged the bridge is haunted by Bonny Prince Charlie's troops.\n The most commonly reported phenomenon is the sound of horses approaching at speed when there is nothing about.\n\nThe bridge is also subject to a local legend which says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.[http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Fatal-crash-car-road-says-expert/story-11566348-detail/story.html#axzz2On4yqTMl A CAR that caused a fatal crash on Swarkestone Bridge should not have been on the road, according to a police vehicle examiner. | This is Derbyshire]\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of the Beaker people living near Swarkestone was discovered in the 1950s. At that time it was estimated that people had lived near Swarkestone for at least 3,800 years.  The only surviving Bronze Age barrow cemetery in the Trent valley is at Swarkestone Lows near the A50. The barrow is a registered national monument. \n\nIn the Domesday Book, Swarkestone was held by the King (William the conqueror) and by Henry de Ferrers.\n\nIn the Battle of Swarkestone Bridge during the English Civil War (1643) it was defended by the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, but the outnumbered Cavaliers lost the day.\n\nIn 1745 during the Jacobite Rebellion led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, the advance party of his army reached here to gain control of the crossing of the Trent. Finding no reports of support from the south, they turned back to Derby; the invading army then retreated to Scotland and final defeat at the Battle of Culloden. Swarkestone thereby being the most southerly point reached during that army's advance on London.\n\nSport\n\nSwarkestone cricket club has gained quite a reputation in recent years. After gaining promotion to the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League in 2011, they finished 2nd in the subsequent year and won the Premier League in the 2013 season, thus becoming the top league team in Derbyshire.\n\nThe Pavilion\n\nNearby is the Jacobean grandstand called Swarkestone Hall Pavilion and walled area, formerly connected with Harpur Hall, where (it is believed, see Pevsner, loc. cit.), they used to bait bulls. The pavilion is attributed to John Smythson who also designed Bolsover Castle, and is Grade I Listed.  It was repaired and is now owned by the Landmark Trust who maintain it and rent it out to holidaymakers.\n\nImages\n\nimage:SwalkestoneLockRH.jpg|Swarkestone Lock and Keeper's House\nimage:SwalkestoneChurchRH.jpg|St James' Church, Swarkestone\nimage:SwalkestoneLowesRH.JPG|Swarkestone Lowes\n\nNotable residents\n\n*Thomas Bancroft, poet, was born here in the early 17th century.Thomas Bancroft in the Dictionary of National Biography\nQuestion:\nThe advance south into England by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 reached approximately as far as the Swarkstone Bridge on which major English River?\nAnswer:\n",

The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the UK singles chart, and it also topped the download chart, remaining on the chart for 22 weeks, half of which were spent in the top 10.

However, since the Stereophonics lacked a fanbase or previous popular success in America, the single was at a great disadvantage and was initially added to very few station playlists. Nevertheless, the popularity of the song and its championing by such stations as WBCN led \"Dakota\" slowly to gain airplay and playlist adds across the country over a period of many months. It became one of the 50 most-played songs in the US by mid-May 2005. However, the song lingered just within the top 50 for months and seemed destined to just miss the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a compilation of just the top 40 most-played alternative rock songs in the US.\nBut \"Dakota\" continued to gain support across the U.S. and eventually become the first Stereophonics song to chart on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It first charted on July 9, 2005, almost half a year after its original release.

DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out \"in solid\" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as \"Blood makes poor mortar\"), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. \"Where's your Moses now?\" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. A remake of his 1923 silent film, DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to filmand who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like, \"Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool\"?\nCredits\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\nTop Critics' Reviews\nFresh: DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking. – Variety Staff, Variety, Jul 7, 2010\nFresh: There is no other picture like it. There will be none. If it could be summed up in a word, the word would be sublime. And the man responsible for that, when all is said and done is Cecil B. DeMille. – James Powers, Hollywood Reporter, Apr 7, 2015\nFresh: DeMille's direction of the action is superb and the various roles are played with feeling by a large and competent cast, headed by Charlton Heston. – Kate Cameron, New York Daily News, Dec 10, 2014\nFresh: With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. De Mille's last feature and most extravagant blockbuster is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects, but it isn't boring for a minute. – Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader, Jun 24, 2010\nQuestion:\n\"In the 1956 film \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\", who played Moses?\"\nAnswer:\n",

Employed as a dance teacher, she taught at locations including the Pineapple Dance Studios and the Italia Conti Stage School. In 1974, Phillips started forming the core of a troupe; Italia Conti student actress Lesley Manville turned her down. Hot Gossip spent two years performing in Munkberry's club in Jermyn Street W1 where Phillips and manager/producers Michael Summerton and Iain Burton developed the group's dance act. Phillips, Summerton and Burton continued to work together for eight years during which time Hot Gossip continued to enjoy wide popularity and success.\n\nCareer\n\nThe Kenny Everett Video Show\n\nSpotted by the British television director David Mallet, he invited Phillips to make Hot Gossip a regular feature of the 1978 The Kenny Everett Video Show, which he directed for Thames Television on ITV. The show ended in 1981 on Thames,then moved to the BBC without Hot Gossip except for Season 4 in  1986.Just a few dancing highlights - 'If My Friends Could See Me Now','Supernature',Floyd's Theme',Shaft','Walk On The Wild Side',Stuff Like That',Hot Child In The City',I Feel Love','The Eve Of War','The Hardest Part' and 'Another Brick In The Wall'.\n\nMusic\n\nIn 1978, during their initial impact period on The Kenny Everett Video Show, Hot Gossip recorded \"Making love on a phone\" and with Sarah Brightman on lead vocals recorded \"I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper\".

The Very Hot Gossip Show was one of the highest rating shows for Channel 4 that year.\n\nStyle\n\nHot Gossip were noted for the risque nature of their costumes and the dance routines, all designed and choreographed by Phillips, especially considering the early evening timeslot that the Video Show was broadcast in. They are often credited as one of the UK's early television dance troupes, continuing a trend which started with the Go-Jo's and Pan's People on Top of the Pops.\n\nThe group was once spoofed on The Benny Hill Show as Hot Gossamer,with references to the Hot Gossip routines 'Supernature' and 'Walk On The Wild Side'.

    "input": "Passage:\nList of FA Cup finals\nThe Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup, is a knockout competition in English football, organised by and named after The Football Association (the FA). It is the oldest existing football competition in the world,  having commenced in the 1871–72 season. The tournament is open to all clubs in the top 10 levels of the English football league system, although a club's home stadium must meet certain requirements prior to entering the tournament.  The competition culminates at the end of the league season usually in May with the FA Cup Final, officially named The Football Association Challenge Cup Final Tie, which has traditionally been regarded as the showpiece finale of the English football season. \n\nAll of the final venues, apart from four, have been in London with most being played at the original Wembley Stadium, which was used from 1923 until the stadium closed in 2000. The new stadium of the same name has been the permanent venue of the final since 2007. Other venues used for the final prior to 1923 were Kennington Oval, Crystal Palace, Stamford Bridge and Lillie Bridge, all in London, Goodison Park in Liverpool and Fallowfield Stadium and Old Trafford in Manchester. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff hosted the final for six years (2001–2006), while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. Other grounds have been used for replays, which until 1999 took place if the initial match ended in a draw.\n\nAs of 2016, the record for the most wins is held by Arsenal and Manchester United with 12 victories. The cup has been won by the same team in two or more consecutive years on ten occasions, and four teams have won consecutive finals more than once: Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. The cup has been won by a non-English team once. The cup is currently held by Manchester United, who defeated Crystal Palace in the 2016 final.\n\nHistory\n\nThe winners of the first tournament were Wanderers, a team of former public schoolboys based in London, who went on to win the competition five times in its first seven seasons. The early winners of the competition were all teams of wealthy amateurs from the south of England,  but in 1883, Blackburn Olympic became the first team from the north to win the cup, defeating Old Etonians. Upon his team's return to Blackburn, Olympic captain Albert Warburton proclaimed: \"The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London.\" \n\nWith the advent of professionalism at around the same time, the amateur teams quickly faded from prominence in the competition. The leading professional clubs formed The Football League in 1888.  Since then, one non-league team has won the cup. Tottenham Hotspur, then of the Southern League, defeated Sheffield United of The Football League to win the 1901 final.  A year later Sheffield United returned to the final and won the cup, which then remained in the hands of Northern and Midland clubs until Tottenham won it again in 1921. In 1927, Cardiff City, a team which plays in the English football league system despite being based in Wales, won the cup, the only non-English club to do so.  Scottish club Queens Park reached the final twice in the early years of the competition.\n\nNewcastle United enjoyed a brief spell of FA Cup dominance in the 1950s, winning the trophy three times in five years, and in the 1960s, Tottenham Hotspur enjoyed a similar spell of success, with three wins in seven seasons. This marked the start of a successful period for London-based clubs, with 11 wins in 22 seasons.  Teams from the second tier of English football, at the time called the Second Division, experienced an unprecedented run of cup success between 1973 and 1980. Sunderland won the cup in 1973, Southampton repeated the feat in 1976, and West Ham United won in 1980, the most recent victory by a team from outside the top division. Since Wimbledon's win in 1988,  the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs of English football,  Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, have between them won the cup 22 times in 27 seasons.\n\nFinals\n\nUntil 1999, a draw in the final would result in the match being replayed at a later date;  since then the final has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout as required.  As of 2015 a penalty shoot-out has been required on only two occasions, in the 2005 and 2006 finals. The competition did not take place during the First and Second World Wars, other than in the 1914–15 season, when it was completed, and the 1939–40 season, when it was abandoned during the qualifying rounds.\n\nKey\n\nAll teams are English, except where marked  (Scottish) or  (Welsh).\n\nResults\n\nA.  The official attendance for the 1923 final was reported as 126,047, but the actual figure is believed to be anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000.  \n\nResults by team\n\nTeams shown in italics are no longer in existence. Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887. \n\nA.  Sheffield Wednesday's total includes two wins and one defeat under the earlier name of The Wednesday.\nB.  Wimbledon relocated in 2004 from south London to Milton Keynes rebranding the club as Milton Keynes Dons, but the current incarnation of the club contends that it was founded in 2004 and does not lay claim to the history or honours (including the FA Cup win) of Wimbledon.\nQuestion:\nWho were the first ever winners of the FA Cup, in 1872?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nJackson Pollock Paintings - Abstract Art Framed\nJackson Pollock Paintings\nStore\nJackson Pollock Paintings\nJackson Pollock paintings are some of the most recognisable and thrilling images produced in the 20th century.  Pollock was  dubbed ‘Jack the Dripper’ by Time magazine due to the unusual way he liked to drip and splatter paint onto his  canvas.   Some of the inspiration for his paintings came from the Native American sand art he saw as a child  and his own method of working resembled a form of ritualised dance around the  canvas which was laid out flat on the floor.\nOne, No. 31\nView at Art.com\nEarly Years\nJackson Pollock was born in  Cody, Wyoming in January 1912, the youngest of five brothers, and grew up in  Arizona and California.  He went to  school at the Manual Arts High School in California and at the age of 18, moved  to New York City to study under the American Regionalist painter, Thomas Hart  Benton, at the Art Students’ League.  The  main subject matter for his work during this period was the life in rural  America he had known as a boy.  During  the 1930s, Pollock was relatively unknown and struggled to survive during the  years of the Depression.   He succeeded  in getting a place on the Federal Art Project which gave him a small income and  enabled him to continue painting. \nKey Influences\nImage From Art.com\nIn 1936 Pollock took part in  the Experimental Workshop run by the Mexican muralist, David Alfaro Siquieros  who encouraged the splattering, hurling and dripping of paint and who  introduced Pollock to the idea of ‘controlled accident’.  The dripping and pouring method of painting  adopted by Pollock in the 1940s also had roots in Surrealist automatism of that  time, a technique which enabled the unconscious mind to express itself  freely.  Pollock  also said of his work that it was ‘akin to  the method of the Indian sand painters of the West’ , a reference to the  American Indian custom of making sand paintings on the floor as part of a  religious ritual.  Pollock borrowed ideas  from all three sources to develop his own radical style of painting.\nMoving Forward\nIn 1942, Pollock had a  breakthrough when he exhibited a painting at the McMillen Gallery in New York  alongside artists such as Picasso, Bonnard and Braque and the young American  artist, Lee Krasner .  Krasner introduced  Pollock to a wider art scene which then led to an introduction to Peggy  Guggenheim who had just opened the Art of This Century Gallery.  She liked his work and offered him a  contract.\nUntitled, Jackson Pollock\nImage From Art.com\nIn 1945, Pollock married Lee Krasner and they  moved to a farmhouse on Long Island where he continued to develop his radical  style of painting.  In 1947 he discarded  the paint brush and began the process of dripping and pouring the paint from  the can or from a stick directly onto a canvas spread on the floor.  These Jackson Pollock paintings, he said, had ‘no  beginning and no end’.  Films made in the  early 1950s show Pollock engaged in a ritualised dance around the canvas. \nCelebrity Artist\nJackson Pollock  paintings executed by the \"drip\" method established  his reputation.  By the late 1940s,  Pollock was a major celebrity and was featured in Time and Life magazines.  Time magazine dubbed him ‘Jack the Dripper’ and Life  magazine, albeit  somewhat cynically, ran the headline ‘Is this the greatest living painter in  the United States?’  This exposure turned  Pollock into a household  name and, for  the general public, he symbolised what was incomprehensible yet hugely exciting  about modern art. \nNumber 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist), 1950, oil, enamel and aluminum on canvas by Jackson Pollock by cliff1066 T, on Flickr\nFinal Years\nPollock abandoned his drip  style in 1951 and began to paint more figuratively again but his painting  output started to decline and then ceased altogether.  He held his last one-man show in 1954.\nHe was a hard-drinker all his  life and had a tendency to live recklessly.  He began an affair in 1956 which led to  separation from his wife.  On 10 August  1956, he was killed instantly when the car he was driving crashed on the road  near his home.  Another passenger in the  car also died but his girlfriend survived.\nBreaking The Ice\nWillem de Kooning said of  Pollock, ‘he broke the ice’, meaning that he was part of something  that brought about the recognition of  Abstract Expressionist artists and created  a market for their work.  Shortly after Pollock’s death, his painting, Autumn Rhythm was sold to the  Metropolitan Museum for $30,000.  This  was unprecedented for an abstract work and had a knock-on effect on the prices  dealers could command for the work of the other Abstract Expressionists.  As Pollock’s dealer Sidney Janis recalled  later, ‘we had a little less trouble selling a de Kooning for $10,000 than we  had a month earlier trying to sell one for $5,000.’\nIn late 1956, The Museum of  Modern Art held a memorial retrospective of Pollock’s work comprising  thirty-five Jackson Pollock paintings and nine watercolours and drawings from  1938-1956.\n \nSign Up!\nKeep

IU's measure the potency of a          drug, not its mass or weight.\nWhat countries besides the U.S. have not adopted the          metric system?\nMany U.S. teachers think the answer is \"Liberia and          Burma\" (make that Myanmar). Let's give Liberia and Myanmar a          break! All countries have adopted the metric system,          including the U.S., and most countries (but not the U.S.)          have taken steps to eliminate most uses of traditional          measurements. However, in nearly all countries people still          use traditional units sometimes, at least in colloquial          expressions. Becoming metric is not a one-time event that          has either happened or not. It is a process that happens          over time. Every country is somewhere in this process of          going metric, some much further along than others.\nCommentary and Explanation\nWire gauge table             (U.S./U.K.)\nIntroduction\nAmericans probably use a greater variety of units of measurement than anyone else in the world. Caught in a slow-moving transition from customary to metric units, we employ a fascinating and sometimes frustrating mixture of units in talking about the same things. We measure the length of a race in meters, but the length of the long jump event in feet and inches. We speak of an engine's power in horsepower and its displacement in liters. In the same dispatch, we describe a hurricane's wind speed in knots and its central pressure in millibars.\nFurthermore, our English customary units do not form a consistent system. Reflecting their diverse roots in Celtic, Roman, Saxon, and Norse cultures, they are often confusing and contradictory. There are two systems for land measurement (one based on the yard and the other on the rod) and a third system for distances at sea. There are two systems (avoirdupois and troy) for small weights and two more (based on the long and short tons) for large weights. Americans use two systems for volumes (one for dry commodities and one for liquids) and the British use a third (British Imperial Measure).\nMeanwhile, only a few Americans know that the legal definitions of the English customary units are actually based on metric units. The U. S. and British governments have agreed that a yard equals exactly 0.9144 meter and an avoirdupois pound equals exactly 0.453 592 37 kilograms. In this way, all the units of measurement Americans use every day are based on the standards of the metric system . Since 1875, in fact, the United States has subscribed to the International System of Weights and Measures , the official version of the metric system.\nThis dictionary began as a collection of notes describing the relationship between various English and metric units. It gradually grew until it finally became too large a word-processing document; I couldn't find my way around in it any more. So I turned it into a folder of html documents and added it to my Internet site. For many months, no one looked at the site except me and my students. Then, gradually, the dictionary began to attract users from around the world. Many users were kind enough to point out errors; others suggested additions and improvements. Questions about units began to appear in my email inbox. Sometimes I could answer the questions, sometimes not.\nToday the dictionary has become a kind of interactive resource. It grows slowly and steadily, mostly through suggestions from readers and my efforts to answer questions posed by readers. You can participate in this process!

    "input": "Passage:\nApéritif and digestif\nApéritifs and digestifs ( and) are drinks, typically alcoholic,  that are normally served before (apéritif) or after (digestif) a meal.\n\nApéritifs\n\nAn apéritif is an alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite, and is therefore usually dry rather than sweet. Common choices for an apéritif are vermouth; champagne; pastis; gin; rakı; fino, amontillado or other styles of dry sherry (but not usually cream sherry, which is very sweet and rich); and any still, dry, light white wine.\n\n\"Apéritif\" may also refer to a snack that precedes a meal. This includes an amuse-bouche, such as crackers, cheese, pâté or olives.  \n\n\"Apéritif\" is a French word derived from the Latin verb aperire, which means \"to open.\" The French slang word for \"apéritif\" is \"apéro,\" although in France an \"apéro\" is also food eaten in the late afternoon/early evening.\n\nHistory\n\nSt. Diadochos of Photiki, in his writing on the Christian Spiritual Life, On Spiritual Knowledge, states, \"People who wish to discipline the sexual organs should avoid drinking those artificial concoctions which are called 'aperitifs'- presumably because they open a way to the stomach for the vast meal which is to follow.\" St. Diadochos was born around 400 A.D. and died sometime before 486 A.D. He was from Northern Greece and was a significant theologian during the Council of Chalcedon (451). Therefore, the use of apéritifs to affect one's consumption of food was a practice in the 5th century. \n\nThe landmark of aperitif birth is 1796, when Antonio Carpano created in Turin the recipe of vermouth.\n\nThe apéritif was introduced in France in 1846 when a French chemist, Joseph Dubonnet, created his eponymous wine-based drink as a means of delivering malaria-fighting quinine. The medicine was a bitter brew, so he developed a formula of herbs and spices to mask quinine's sharp flavor, and it worked so well that the recipe has remained well-guarded ever since. French Foreign Legion soldiers made use of it in mosquito-infested Northern Africa. Joseph's wife was so fond of the drink that she had all her friends try it, and its popularity spread.\n\nApéritifs were already widespread in the 19th century in Italy, where they were being served in fashionable cafés in Rome, Genoa, Florence, Milan, Turin, and Venice. Apéritifs became very popular in Europe in the late 19th century. The popularity in Europe crossed the Atlantic and by 1900, they were also commonly served in the United States. The apéritif recrossed the Atlantic in the 1970s: the habit of a substantial food offering with the purchase of a drink during \"Happy Hour\" in the United States pushed the development of a more food-heavy apéritif in Italy as well. \nIn Spain and in some countries of Latin America, apéritifs have been a staple of tapas for centuries.\n\nTypes\n\nThere is no single alcoholic drink that is always served as an apéritif. Fortified wine, liqueur, and dry champagne are probably the most common choices. Because it is served before dining, the emphasis is usually on dry rather than sweet, as a general guideline.\n\n* In France, the apéritif varies from region to region : pastis is popular in the south of France, Calvados brandy in the Normandy region, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne wine or Cognac may also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and very popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (black currant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The word Kir Royal is used when white wine is replaced with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches.\n* In Italy, vermouth or wine may be served as the apéritif (called aperitivo). Aperol spritz and Campari with soda are also popular aperitivo drinks of choice.\n* In Greece, ouzo is a popular choice, except on Crete, where it is very common to take some raki after a meal.\n* In the Eastern Mediterranean, arak is served with meze.\n\nDigestifs\n\nA digestif is an alcoholic beverage served after a meal, in theory, to aid digestion.  When served after a coffee course, it may be called pousse-café.  Digestifs are usually taken straight.\nCommon kinds of digestif include: \n* Brandy (Cognac, Armagnac, alembic-made) \n** Eaux de vie (fruit brandies, Schnapps, Calvados)\n** Pomace brandy (grappa)\n* Fortified wines (sweet sherry (usually cream sherry), vermouth, port, and madeira)\n* Liqueurs bitter or sweet (drambuie, amari (such as fernet), herbal liqueur, chartreuse, Grand Marnier, Jagermeister, Irish Mist, Kahlua, limoncello, Herbs de Majorca, Unicum, Underberg, Fernet-Branca, Mirto)\n* Distilled liquors (ouzo, tequila, whisky or akvavit)\n* Liquor cocktails (Black Russian, Rusty Nail, etc.)\n\nIn certain areas, it is not uncommon for a digestif to be taken before a main course. One example is le trou Normand, a glass of Calvados taken before the main course of a meal.\n\nBitter digestifs typically contain carminative herbs, which are thought to aid digestion. \n\nIn many countries, people drink alcoholic beverages at lunch and dinner. Studies have found that when food is eaten before drinking alcohol, alcohol absorption is reduced and the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the blood is increased. The mechanism for the faster alcohol elimination appears to be unrelated to the type of food. The likely mechanism is food-induced increases in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and liver blood flow.\nQuestion:\nWhich aperitif is named for the Paris chemist who created it in 1846?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nCalcium & Blood Clotting | LIVESTRONG.COM\nCalcium & Blood Clotting | LIVESTRONG.COM\nCalcium & Blood Clotting\nLast Updated: Aug 16, 2013\nLaura Parr\nLaura Parr began her professional writing career in 2008 contributing to websites such as Travelbox, 1stop and Traveldojo. She now writes health and fitness-related articles. Parr earned a diploma of adult nursing from the University of Brighton, followed by a postgraduate certificate in public health from the University of Manchester.\nCalcium plays an essential role in blood clotting. Photo Credit boiling blood image by Adrian Hillman from <a href=\"http://www.fotolia.com\">Fotolia.com</a>\nYour body uses calcium not only to keep teeth and bones strong, but also to enable muscles to contract, to assist in the transmission of neural impulses and to maintain cell membrane stability and permeability. It is also an important part of the blood clotting process and because your body is unable to generate calcium, it is important that you have adequate daily intake.\nThe Clotting Process\nWhenever your skin becomes broken, the sticky platelets contained in the blood form clots to stop blood flow. Calcium works together with vitamin K and a protein called fibrinogen in the clotting cascade. Without adequate levels of calcium and vitamin K, blood will take longer to clot, and if both nutrients are missing you might bleed to death. Most people gain enough calcium and vitamin K from their diets, but in some cases supplements may be prescribed.\nThe Clotting Cascade\nAs soon as blood from a wound is exposed to the air, the platelets disintegrate and react with fibrinogen to create fibrin: a mass of tiny threads. This triggers a whole series of reactions that rely on adequate levels of calcium and vitamin K to work. The fibrin hardens very quickly to form a scab over the wound.\nFoods that Contain Calcium\nSpinach and other dark green vegetables contain high levels of calcium. Photo Credit Blattspinat image by Yvonne Bogdanski from Fotolia.com\nLow-fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt and cheese contain a lot of calcium, and you will also find calcium in dried beans, tofu, spinach, broccoli and dark green vegetables. Certain cereals, vegan dairy substitutes and juices may be fortified with it. You must get an adequate daily intake of vitamin D to assist your body's absorption of calcium, so make sure that if you take calcium supplements, they contain vitamin D as well.\nRecommended Intake\nAdults under the age of 50 need around 1,000 mg calcium each day while older adults need around 1,200 mg each day. Children and adolescents need a higher intake of calcium because they grow rapidly. Those under 10 should get around 400 to 800 mg each day and those aged 11 to 24 need around 1,200 to 1,500 mg every day.\nDo I Need Extra Calcium?\nMost people gain enough calcium from their diet, but if you don't you could be prescribed dietary supplements. Photo Credit Fallen brown bottle of last yellow pills isolated on white image by Olga Sapegina from Fotolia.com\nMost people gain enough calcium by eating a healthy and varied diet, but those at risk include menopausal women who may be at risk of rapid bone loss, vegetarians and those who are lactose intolerant because they may not be getting enough calcium from their diets. If you feel that you may be at risk contact your family physician.\nMeeting Your Calcium Needs\nSome cereals are fortified with calcium. Photo Credit rural life(cereals) image by Aleksandr Popov from Fotolia.com\nIf you have been told that you need to increase your calcium intake, try using low-fat or fat-free milk to make mashed potatoes, puddings and smoothies. Add low-fat or fat-free cheese to meals or try calcium-fortified tofu with fried vegetables or meat. Include other calcium-fortified foods such as cereals and drinks in your diet.\nRelated Searches\nLose Weight.

    "input": "Passage:\nAugustus - Ancient History - HISTORY.com\nAugustus - Ancient History - HISTORY.com\nGoogle\nAugustus: Birth and Inheritance\nOf Augustus’ many names and honorifics, historians favor three of them, each for a different phase in the emperor’s life. From his birth in 63 B.C. he was Octavius; after his adoption was announced in 44 B.C., Octavian; and beginning in 26 B.C. the Roman Senate conferred on him the name Augustus, the august or exalted one. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Velletri, 20 miles from Rome. His father was a senator and governor in the Roman Republic. His mother Atai was Caesar’s niece, and the young Octavius was raised in part by his grandmother Julia Ceasaris, Caesar’s sister.\nDid You Know?\nIn 8 B.C. Augustus had the Roman month of Sextilius renamed after himself—as his great-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar had done with July. August was the month of several of the emperor's greatest victories, including the defeat and suicide of Antony and Cleopatra. He did not increase the month's length, which had been 31 days since the establishment of the Julian calendar in 45 B.C.\nOctavius donned the toga, the Roman sign of manhood, at age 16, and began taking on responsibilities through his family connections. In 47 B.C. he went to Hispania (modern-day Spain) to fight alongside Caesar. He was shipwrecked along the way, and had to cross enemy territory to reach his great-uncle—an act that impressed Caesar enough to name Octavius his heir and successor in his will.\nAugustus: The Path to Power\nThe 17-year-old Octavius was at Apollonia (in present-day Albania) when the news of Caesar’s death and his own inheritance arrived. The dead ruler’s allies, including many in the senate, rallied around Octavian against their powerful rival Mark Antony . But after Octavian’s troops defeated Antony’s army in northern Italy, the future emperor refused an all-out pursuit of Antony, preferring an uneasy alliance with his rival.\nIn 43 B.C. Octavian, Antony and Marcus Aemilus Lepidus established the Second Triumvirate, a power-sharing agreement that divided up Rome’s territories among them, with Antony given the East, Lepidus Africa and Octavian the West. In 41 B.C. Antony began a romantic and political alliance with Cleopatra , queen of Egypt, which continued even after a Senatorial decree forced his marriage to Octavian’s sister Octavia Minor. Lepidus remained a minor figure until Octavian finally had him ousted after the triumvirate’s renewal in 37 B.C.\nAntony’s affair with Cleopatra continued, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia. In retaliation, Octavian declared war on Cleopatra. In the naval battle of Actium a year later, Octavian’s fleet, under his admiral Agrippa, cornered and defeated Antony’s ships. Cleopatra’s navy raced to aid her ally, but in the end the two lovers barely escaped. They returned to Egypt and committed suicide, leaving Octavian as Rome’s undisputed ruler.\nAugustus: Emperor in All but Name\nHistorians date the start of Octavian’s monarchy to either 31 B.C. (the victory at Actium) or 27 B.C., when he was granted the name Augustus. In that four-year span, Octavian secured his rule on multiple fronts. Cleopatra’s seized treasure allowed him to pay his soldiers, securing their loyalty. To mollify Rome’s Senate and ruling classes, he passed laws harkening back—at least on the surface—to the traditions of the Roman Republic. And to win over the people, he worked to improve and beautify the city of Rome.\nDuring his 40-years reign, Augustus nearly doubled the size of the empire, adding territories in Europe and Asia Minor and securing alliances that gave him effective rule from Britain to India. He spent much of his time outside of Rome, consolidating power in the provinces and instituting a system of censuses and taxation that integrated the empire’s furthest reaches. He expanded the Roman network of roads, founded the Praetorian Guard and the Roman postal service and remade Rome with both grand (a new forum) and practical gestures (police and fire departments).\nAugustus: Family and Succession\nAugustus married three times, although his first union, to Mark Antony’s stepdaughter Clodia Pulchra, was unconsummated. His second wife, Scribonia, bore his only child, Julia the Elder. He divorced in 39 B.C. to marry Livia Drusilla, who had two sons—Tiberius and Drusus—by her first husband, Mark Antony’s ally Tiberius Claudius Nero . The family tree became more complicated after Augustus had his stepson Tiberius briefly marry his daughter, and then adopted Tiberius outright as son and successor in A.D. 4.\nAugustus Caesar died in A.D. 14, his empire secured and at peace. His reported last words were twofold: to his subjects he said, “I found Rome of clay; I leave it to you of marble,” but to the friends who had stayed with him in his rise to power he added, “Have I played the part well? Then applaud me as I exit.” Soon after that acknowledgement of human frailty, the Roman Senate officially declared their departed emperor, like Julius Caesar before him, to be a god.\nTags\nQuestion:\nWho was the first emperor of Rome?\nAnswer:\n",

Here’s why you never saw her face—and why you need to hear her story.\n07.25.16 5:15 PM ET\nWe’ve all heard Marni Nixon’s voice. But only some of us have heard her story.\nEven though you probably couldn’t pick her face out in a crowd, Marni Nixon might have been the most important performer in the Hollywood movie musical boom of the ’50s and ’60s—and certainly the most talented singer. \nNixon, who died Sunday at age 86 , dubbed the singing voices for Deborah Kerr in The King and I, Natalie Wood in West Side Story , and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. Though the trio of legends brought Anna, Maria, and Eliza to the big screen, it was Nixon’s voice who brought them to life—and and into our hearts.  \nIt’s a story that would be fodder for its own Hollywood film…if it already wasn’t essentially the plot for Singin’ in the Rain. Just as studios started to rely on the star power of its greatest actresses to topline its movie musicals, Nixon, who had perfect pitch and a remarkable ability to sing any piece of music handed to her, was brought in to make their vocal performances more palatable. \nIn a way, Marni Nixon was the original autotune. Not that she would ever need it—listen to her indelible versions of “I Could Have Danced All Night” or “Somewhere” for proof of that. One of her first big jobs was singing the high notes that Marilyn Monroe couldn’t reach for Gentleman Prefer Blondes, landing the assignment to dub Kerr’s voice in The King and I soon after. \nThat Nixon did this was, of course, a secret. She received no screen credit for her work on those legendary films. She signed the scary contracts and kept mum in order to ensure that word never got out. Of course, it did eventually. TIME magazine caught wind of her work and unveiled her as the industry’s “ghostess with the mostest” in a 1964 article. \nDespite the fact that the movies she sang for became blockbuster hits and instant classics, with West Wide Story and My Fair Lady even earning Best Picture Oscars, Nixon was so anonymous that she even appeared as a contestant on a 1964 episode of To Tell the Truth , the game show in which the contestant is joined by two imposters and celebrity panelists attempt to discern who is the real deal. Two of the four panelists correctly identified Nixon; perhaps her lying skills weren’t as prolific as her singing voice. \nIn a recent Washington Post article , Nixon graciously referred to her uncredited contributions as “just part of the working singer’s job in Hollywood,” saying that “you just worked any way you can.” \nShe told WNYC in 2009 that “they thought of course that if you did some ghost work that probably you weren’t really appearing on stage and that meant something was probably wrong with you, like you were too fat or ugly or cross-eyed or something.” That To Tell the Truth clip from 1964 suggests that certainly is not true. She was just as beautiful as she was talented. She just didn’t boast the name recognition of an Audrey Hepburn or a Deborah Kerr.\nHilariously, Nixon spilled that often the actresses for which she was doing dubbing work didn’t know their voices were being dubbed until their films came out, or at least not to what extent. Wood and Hepburn, for example, were under the impression that only some of their singing would be replaced by Nixon—the high notes too lofty to hit—not the entire musical performance. \n“In the case of Audrey Hepburn, she was very smart and could say, ‘I know this is not good enough, I want to keep trying myself,’ but she had to accept that it wasn’t quite what it should be,” Nixon told The Washington Post . “But I don’t think that Natalie Wood’s ego could take that. Frankly, I think they used to create that kind of attitude too much—allowing them to have the illusion when they knew all along that she wasn’t good enough.”\nShe and Kerr had a wonderful working relationship, though. Kerr knew from the get-go that she would be dubbed, and worked side by side with Nixon to make sure that her acting performance matched Nixon’s vocal one. In an article titled “Deborah Kerr Tells Secret,” the actress even happily divulged that it was Nixon who did the singing.\nWhen Nixon told her after the interview was published that people weren’t supposed to know, Nixon recalls that Kerr winkingly told her, “I don’t have to know that’s in your contract.” Recalling the memory, Nixon said about Kerr, “She was that gracious. She was wonderful.” \nIn the end, the fact that these movie musicals featured dubbed singing didn’t harm their legacies at all. Though, as NPR’s Linda Holmes noted Monday on Twitter , it says a lot about the industry and our culture that “Hollywood thought a young Puerto Rican, a poor English girl, and a prim schoolteacher should all sound like the same person.” \nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!\nDaily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.\nCheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).\nQuestion:\n\"Who dubbed the singing voice for Audrey Hepburn in the film version of \"\"My Fair Lady\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\n",

Born on a farm at Ettrick, he had ambitions to be a writer from an early age and came to believe that he might emulate Burns. He was still working as a shepherd when his first, unsuccessful, volume of poems appeared in 1801. The following year he met Scott who would champion him over many years.\nImage Rights Holder:\n205:The National Galleries of Scotland, Phase 1\nMaterial:\nPainting: James Hogg, 1770 - 1835.

Watson Gordon's portrait, which hints at both poet and shepherd, was painted in 1830 to hang in Blackwood's salon. Hogg's last work of note was Domestic Manners and Private Life of Sir Walter Scott which was published two years after Scott's death - to the annoyance of Scott's biographer, Lockhart - and shortly before Hogg's own death.

Many times reprinted, it contains his most quoted piece of verse, 'Kilmeny'. Thereafter his work ranged from the brilliant parodies of contemporary poets in The Poetic Mirror to the works in prose: The Brownie of Bodsbeck, The Three Perils of Man, and, most remarkable of all, The Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, which introduced the theme of the evil doppelganger into Scottish literature.\nAll Rights Burns Scotland\nQuestion:\nWhich poet (1770-1835) was known as the Ettrick Shepherd?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nWhere Is Cathay - Asian History from About.com\nWhere Is Cathay\nWhere Is Cathay?\nBy Kallie Szczepanski\nQuestion: Where Is Cathay?\nAround the year 1300, a book took Europe by storm. It was Marco Polo's account of his travels to a fabulous country called Cathay, and all of the wonders he had seen there. He described black stones that burned like wood (coal), saffron-robed Buddhist monks, and money made out of paper. But where was this wondrous land of Cathay?\n \nAnswer:\nOf course, Cathay was actually China , which at that time was under Mongol rule. Marco Polo served in the court of Kublai Khan , founder of the Yuan Dynasty, and grandson of Genghis Khan.\nThe name \"Cathay\" is a European variation of \"Khitai,\" which Central Asian tribes used to describe parts of northern China once dominated by the Khitan people . The Mongols had since crushed the Khitan clans and absorbed their people, erasing them as a separate ethnic identity, but their name lived on as a geographical designation.\nSince Marco Polo and his party approached China via Central Asia, along the Silk Road, they naturally heard the name Khitai used for the empire they sought.\ncontinue reading below our video\nWhat are the Seven Wonders of the World\nThe southern part of China, which had not yet capitulated to Mongol rule, was known at that time as Manzi, which is Mongol for \"the recalcitrant ones.\"\nIt would take Europe almost 300 years to put two and two together, and realize that Cathay and China were one and the same. Between about 1583 and 1598, the Jesuit missionary to China, Matteo Ricci , developed the theory that China was actually Cathay. He was well acquainted with Marco Polo's account, and noticed striking similarities between Polo's observations of Cathay and his own of China.\nFor one thing, Marco Polo had noted that Cathay was directly south of \"Tartary,\" or Mongolia , and Ricci knew that Mongolia lay on the northern border of China. Marco Polo also described the empire as being divided by the Yangtze River, with six provinces to the north of the river and nine to the south. Ricci knew that this description matched China. Ricci observed many of the same phenomena that Polo had noted, as well, such as people burning coal for fuel and using paper as money.\nThe final straw, for Ricci, was when he met Muslim traders from the west in Beijing in 1598. They assured him that he was indeed living in the fabled country of Cathay.\nAlthough the Jesuits publicized this discovery widely in Europe, some skeptical mapmakers believed that Cathay still existed somewhere, perhaps northeast of China, and drew it onto their maps in what is now southeastern Siberia. As late as 1667, John Milton refused to give up on Cathay, naming it as a separate place from China in Paradise Lost .\nQuestion:\nCathay is a poetic name for which country?\nAnswer:\n",

But Andy Williams made his own claim to the song by using it as the title to this LP of movie themes, which, not coincidentally, was released in the week before Williams was scheduled to sing \"Moon River\" at the 1962 Academy Awards ceremony. He does a masterful version with the song, and also does well with the rest of the songs, which include some recent fare (\"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,\" \"A Summer Place,\" \"The Exodus Song,\" \"The Second Time Around\"), but also old favorites like \"As Time Goes By.\" \"Maria\" and \"Tonight\" are the big ballads from West Side Story, which began life as a Broadway musical before it went on to be the big movie hit of 1961, justifying the use of the music here. Williams has fun with \"Never on Sunday,\" even including the Greek lyrics. The LP, a highlight in the singer's career, makes a case that the early '60s constituted a renaissance period for movie themes. (Spurred on by Williams ' 1962 Oscar Night performance of \"Moon River\" and its victory in the Best Song category, Moon River & Other Great Movie Themes went on to spend 176 weeks in the Billboard LPs chart, peaking at number three and going gold.

For a moment, he thought he heard a woman's name being blown in the wind— Ten years later, James changed his name to Jimi Hendrix and formed the band, The Experience. When they debuted at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, Hendrix set his guitar on fire and began a new chapter in the history of rock. He died three years later of an accidental drug overdose.\n \nExcerpt: 'Jimi: Sounds Like A Rainbow'\nThe guitarist's story is know to many adult fans. But now, the story of young Jimi Hendrix's is now told in a new children's book by author Gary Golio and illustrator Javaka Steptoe, called \"Jimi Sounds Like a Rainbow: A Story of the Young Jimi Hendrix.\"\nIn addition to writing children's books Gary Golio is a children's therapist. As he tells Weekend Edition Saturday Host Liane Hansen, he feels that telling Hendrix's story to children helps them find their own path.\n\"Many of the kids I see if I say to them, what do you want to be when you grow up? Alot of them say 'I don't know',\" he says. \"If you don't have a goal as a young person, you're really adrift. Jimi had nothing materially, he was quite poor, but in his imagination, inside of himself, he lived a very rich inner life.\nGolio says that there are many important lessons to be learned from the young Jimi Hendrix.\n\"If you pass through the mythology about him, his childhood reflects all the values that we want to teach our children about. Persistence, and loving what you do, and having goals, positive goals, and investing yourself.

It reached a climax with the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony on 27 July 2012, starting a 60-day festival of sport and culture across the UK, as the Olympic and Paralympic spirit crosses the world once again.\nLondon 2012 by numbers\nThe Olympic Games are one of the biggest and most complex events in the world, as highlighted by some of these mind-boggling facts and figures:\n26 sports, featuring 39 disciplines, were contested during the Games across 34 venues\nThe Olympic Park, which held nine venues, was 2.5sq km in size – equivalent to 357 football pitches\n8.8 million tickets were available for the London 2012 Olympic Games\nAbout 10,500 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees took part in the Games, with 302 medal events being held\nOver 21,000 accredited media communicated the Games to a potential worldwide audience of 4 billion people\nThere were also 2,961 technical officials and 5,770 team officials\nA total workforce of around 200,000 people, including more than 6,000 staffs, 70,000 volunteers and 100,000 contractors, were involved in the Games\nLOCOG had sourced over one million pieces of sport equipment for the Games, including 510 adjustable hurdles for athletics, 600 basket balls, 2,700 foot balls and 356 pairs of boxing gloves\nDuring the Games, 20 million spectator journeys were made in London, including three million on the busiest day of the Games\nApproximately 14 million meals were served at the Games, including 45,000 per day in the Olympic Village\nOn the obverse, the traditional goddess of victory flies into the Panathinaikos stadium bringing victory to the best athlete. For these Games, the figure of victory is accompanied by the specific inscription: “ XXX Olympiad London 2012 ”.\nThe reverse features an abstract design with the 2012 Games emblem at its centre as a metaphor for the modern city. The design also includes a ribbon representing London’s Thames river and an interlocking grid pattern that radiates from the centre and pulls the design together, giving it a sense of outreach while also representing the achievements and efforts of Olympic athletes. A square, which encases the balance of the design, opposes the circular shape of the medals and emphasizes its focus on the centre, reinforcing the sense of ‘place, as in a map inset.\nMore info\nWenlock\nWenlock takes his name from the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire, which still hosts the traditional Much Wenlock Games.

    "input": "Passage:\nGiant Haystacks\nMartin Austin Ruane (10 October 1946 – 29 November 1998)  was an English professional wrestler. Best known by the ring name Giant Haystacks, he wrestled all over the world. Ruane was known for his massive physical size, billed as standing  tall and weighing 48 stone 13 lb (685 lb; 311 kg) at his heaviest.\n\nEarly life\n\nRuane was born in Camberwell, London,   weighing 14 lb 6 oz (6.5 kg). His parents were originally from County Mayo, Ireland.  When he was three years old, in 1949, Ruane and his family moved from London to Broughton, Greater Manchester, which remained his home. He worked as a labourer and a nightclub bouncer before a friend suggested he take up professional wrestling as a career.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nEarly career\n\nRuane began wrestling in 1967, initially for the independent WFGB as Luke McMasters (later incorrectly reported as being his legal name).  In the early 1970s, Ruane worked for Wrestling Enterprises (of Birkenhead), where he was billed as Haystacks Calhoun, after the American wrestling star William Calhoun who had wrestled under that name in NWA: All-Star Wrestling and the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Ruane's name was subsequently modified to Giant Haystacks.\n\nJoint Promotions\n\nIn 1975, he moved to Joint Promotions, where he formed a heel tag team with Big Daddy (also a heel at this point). Haystacks' TV debut came in July that year, when he and Daddy teamed up against the brothers Roy and Tony St Clair, losing by disqualification. Although mainly known as brutal superheavyweight heels who crushed blue-eye opponents, they also had a major feud with masked fellow heel Kendo Nagasaki.\n\nDaddy in particular heard cheers during this feud and eventually completed a turn to blue eye. This was cemented when Haystacks and Daddy broke up their tag team in 1977 and feuded with each other, with Haystacks remaining as the heel, resulting in high ratings on Britain's ITV any time they battled one another and establishing Haystacks as a household name during the 1970s and 1980s. The feud would continue on and off until Daddy's retirement in 1993.\n\nInternational appearances\n\nThroughout Haystacks' homeland success he also wrestled all over the world. Ruane wrestled in Calgary, Alberta, Canada for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion as the Loch Ness Monster, managed by J.R. Foley from Wigan, England (alias John Foley, alumnus of Billy Riley's Wigan Snakepit wrestling school). He also regularly worked for the CWA in Germany and Austria, winning several trophy tournaments over there.\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling\n\nIn 1996, Ruane debuted in the United States for World Championship Wrestling, under the ring name Loch Ness.   He served as a member of The Dungeon of Doom and feuded with Hulk Hogan. However, the feud was short-lived, ending abruptly when Ruane was diagnosed with cancer and returned to England.\n\nOther media\n\nRuane appeared in the 1981 film Quest for Fire and the 1984 film Give My Regards to Broad Street. The latter was written by Paul McCartney, a fan of Ruane. \n\nPersonal life\n\nOn 29 November 1998, Ruane died of cancer in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. He was 52.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* In the song \"Me and Stephen Hawking\" from their 2009 album Journal for Plague Lovers, Welsh rock group Manic Street Preachers included the lyrics \"a hundred thousand watch Giant Haystacks in a Bombay fight\".\n* A play by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks, was performed at the Brighton Festival Fringe between 26 and 28 May 2011. \n*In BBC show The Thick of It, Malcolm Tucker referred to overweight politician Ben Swain as Giant Gaystacks at one point which is a play on words of Giant Haystacks.\n\nIn wrestling\n\n*Finishing moves\n** Elbow drop\n** Standing splash\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\n* British Wrestling Federation\n** BWF European Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n* Joint Promotions\n** Joint Promotions British Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n* Stampede Wrestling\n** Stampede International Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Dynamite Kid (1) and Bret Hart (1)\nQuestion:\nWeighing-in at up 48 stone, who wrestled under the ring-name Giant Haystacks?\nAnswer:\n",

He began his career on stage in 1937 and over sixty years later, Malden was still going strong, with a 2000 appearance on TV's The West Wing. In the intervening years, Malden not only won an Oscar®, but also an Emmy, a SAG lifetime achievement award, as well as several Golden Globe nominations. He starred in a hit TV series and worked with an impressive list of Hollywood greats, from actors like Marlon Brando and Burt Lancaster to directors such as Elia Kazan and John Ford.\nHe was born Mladen Sekulovich on March 22, 1912 in Chicago. Malden's mother was Czech and his father Serbian. Raised in Gary, Indiana, Malden spoke Serbian as a child - and never learned English until he was in kindergarten. His father often produced plays at the local church. Malden appeared in many of these productions, including a stage version of Jack and the Beanstalk. In high school, he participated in drama and basketball. According to his autobiography, it was on the court that Malden's trademark nose was shaped; he apparently broke it twice while playing basketball.\nAfter school, Malden, like many in his hometown, took a job in a steel factory. But in 1934, he left the factory, hoping to find more meaningful work. He attended the Arkansas State Teacher's College for a short time before enrolling at Chicago's Goodman Dramatic School. After graduation, Malden headed for New York where he joined the Group Theatre. Founded in 1931, the Group Theatre taught the groundbreaking Stanislavski method of acting. Here, Malden would make his Broadway debut in 1937's Golden Boy. One of his co-stars in the play, and another Group Theatre regular, was Elia Kazan.\nMalden made his screen debut with a small part in 1940's They Knew What They Wanted. World War II would soon interrupt, putting his career aspirations on hold. During the war, Malden served as a noncommissioned officer in the 8th Air Force. He did make one wartime film, the star-filled recruiting drama Winged Victory (1944). The film led to a brief contract with Fox and Malden made several post-war movies for the studio including the spy thriller 13 Rue Madeleine (1947), Kiss of Death (1947), a crime drama with Victor Mature and Richard Widmark, and Boomerang! (1947), which starred Dana Andrews and was directed by old friend Kazan.\nThe same year, Kazan would cast Malden in two Broadway productions - first in Arthur Miller's All My Sons and then in Tennessee William's A Streetcar Named Desire. Most of the Streetcar cast, including Malden, made the jump to the big screen in 1951 for a film adaptation of the play. For his role as Mitch, Malden was awarded the Best Supporting Actor Oscar®. A Streetcar Named Desire also won Oscar®s for Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), Best Supporting Actress (Kim Hunter), and Best Art Direction, as well as receiving eight more nominations. The film marked a definite turning point in Malden's career. After his Oscar® win, the roles started coming more quickly - and they were leading roles.\nMalden's next big film (again with Kazan and Brando), came in 1954 with On the Waterfront. He would again be Oscar® nominated for his portrayal of Father Barry, the meddling, yet sympathetic priest. Malden rounded out the 50s with strong performances in films like: Baby Doll (1956), where he played a man married to a teenager; Fear Strikes Out (1957) a baseball biopic starring Anthony Perkins; and The Hanging Tree (1959), a Gary Cooper western that cast Malden as the villain. He also found time to direct his only film, the Korean War drama Time Limit (1957).\nThe 60s were equally busy for Malden. He teamed with Brando again in the revisionist western One-Eyed Jacks (1961). He played warden to Burt Lancaster's lifetime prisoner in Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) and he was Natalie Wood's agent in Gypsy (1962). He also appeared in John Ford's last western, Cheyenne Autumn (1964); a turn opposite Steve McQueen and Edward G. Robinson in the poker classic The Cincinnati Kid (1965); and a co-starring role in Billion Dollar Brain (1967) with Michael Caine.\nBy the '70s, roles were proving a little scarce for Malden though he did kick off the decade with a bang, playing Omar Bradley to George C. Scott's Patton (1970). In 1972, he took a job in television as Detective Mike Stone on The Streets of San Francisco. He was teamed with a then unknown Michael Douglas. The series ran five seasons (from 1972 - 1977) on ABC. Malden was Emmy nominated four times as Best Actor for The Streets of San Francisco but he never won (Malden's only Emmy win would come in 1985 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Special for Fatal Vision [1984]).\nMalden served as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1989 - 1992. And in 2003, he received the Screen Actors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award. It was presented by his old television co-star Michael Douglas. Upon receiving the award, Malden remarked, \"I am thrilled to be honored by the Screen Actors Guild because I've been with it for such a long time. The Screen Actors Guild is sort of a highfalutin name for a union, and this union was always wonderful to work for. For the rank-and-file of the union to honor me is the best compliment I can receive.\"\nby Stephanie Thames\nQuestion:\nFor which film in 1951, starring Marlon Brando, did Karl Malden win the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor?\nAnswer:\n",

As the country's chief international and domestic airport, it is definitely Southern Africa's busiest airport. It is the main airport of South African Airways as well as several other local airlines. Designated Africa's leading airport in the 2005 World Travel Awards, O.R.Tambo International Airport is a hub of convenience and comfort for travelers.\nThe airport, originally named Jan Smuts Airport, was established in 1952. Right from its beginnings, the airport gained the great privilege of receiving a De Havilland Comet jet's first commercial flight from London's Heathrow International Airport to the city of Johannesburg. In the 1970s it took part in Concorde tests as a high altitude airport. In 1994 the new South African government renamed Jan Smuts Airport to Johannesburg  International Airport and established a policy stating that airports would not be named for politicians. By 1996 Johannesburg International had taken the lead from Cairo International Airport as Africa's busiest airport. In 2004 some 15.3 million passengers passed through the airport. 27 October 2006 brought another name change to the airport. Under much criticism it was named O.R.Tambo International Airport in honor of the past ANC President.\nO.R.Tambo International Airport has 2 parallel north-south runways. The western runway is amongst the longest in the world, measuring 4,400m. The airports 6 terminals are divided into the domestic terminal, the transit terminal and the international terminal. In 2003 the domestic terminal was upgraded and reopened offering travelers greater facilities. The terminal is focused around the convenience of all its travelers with necessary amenities, easy movement and quick drop-off/pick-up zones. O.R.Tambo Airport's updated facilities include a wide variety of restaurants and shops as well as ATM's and other banking services. The airport also has an outstanding medical clinic with doctors, physiotherapists, optometrists and a dentist. Business men and women can take advantage of the great Internet connections including wireless. The relatively new parkade offers more than 5,000 parking bays. There is plenty of transport to and from O.R.Tambo International Airport including taxis, shuttles and buses. It is projected that by 2015 the airport will be handling some 24 million passengers every year.\nTags:\nQuestion:\nWhich African city is served by O R Tambo airport?\nAnswer:\n",

The group, which included Daniel Bedingfield, Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Bono of U2, and Paul McCartney, re-recorded the 1984 song \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure.\n\nRecording\n\nThe song was recorded on 14 November 2004, to benefit Sudan's troubled Darfur region, and was released that same month. The single became the UK's biggest seller of 2004 as well as the Christmas number one. \n\nBono and Paul McCartney were the only artists from the original Band Aid to lend their voices to Band Aid 20. There was a reported dispute over the line 'Well tonight thank God it's them, instead of you', which Bono sang on the original version. Justin Hawkins, of The Darkness, laid down a version of the line, but Bono insisted on re-recording his version, which was eventually used on the record.\n\nA special documentary titled Band Aid 20: Justice, Not Charity which went behind-the-scenes of the new recording was broadcast by BBC One on 6 December 2004.\n\nRelease\n\nThe Band Aid 20 single was first played simultaneously on The Chris Moyles Show (on BBC Radio 1) and the breakfast shows on Virgin and Capital radio, at 8 am on 16 November 2004. The video was first broadcast in the UK simultaneously over multiple channels, including the five UK terrestrial channels, at 5:55pm on 18 November 2004, with an introduction by Madonna.\n\nOne of the new ways to buy the song, by downloading it from the internet, hit a problem when Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store initially refused to supply it, due to their fixed-pricing policy. A partial solution was reached after a few days, enabling UK users to download the song at the standard iTunes price, with Apple donating an extra amount (equivalent to the price difference) to the Band Aid Trust.\n\nThe single sold 72,000 copies in the first 24 hours when it was released on 29 November 2004, and went straight in at No. 1 in the UK singles chart on 5 December 2004. The CD version sold over 200,000 copies in the first week, becoming the fastest-selling single of the year. It stayed at No. 1 for Christmas and the week after, a total of four weeks, one week shorter than the 1984 original.\n\nThe single was supported by companies such as the mobile entertainment provider, WebTV, which allowed customers to play and purchase the song and music video on their mobile phones. It could also be purchased with a bundle of tracks including both the original 1984 version and the 2004 version of \"Do They Know It’s Christmas?\". HMV stores opened early to give customers more time to buy the single and staff at wore Band Aid 20 shirts that said, “Have you bought your Copy Yet?” Prime Minister Tony Blair was seen picking up a copy of the charity single at an HMV store in Edinburgh.\n\nCritical reception\n\nBand Aid 20's efforts met with mixed criticism. The BBC said the new generation of singers, who differed greatly from those that appeared on the 1984 original, endeavored to fit their talents into a 20-year-old template resulting in an \"anonymous\" record.  The Guardian said the appearance of female singers was successful. \n\nArtwork\n\nBritish artist Damien Hirst designed an intimidating cover for the Band Aid 20 single, featuring the grim reaper and a starving African child. However, this was later dropped after fears that it might scare children.\n\nParticipants\n\nOrganisers and producers:\n*Midge Ure – organiser\n*Nigel Godrich (Radiohead, Travis) – producer\n*Bob Geldof – producer\n*Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz)\n\nInstruments:\n*Danny Goffey (Supergrass) – (drums)\n*Thom Yorke – (piano) and Jonny Greenwood – (guitar) – (Radiohead)\n*Sir Paul McCartney – bass guitar\n*Justin Hawkins and Dan Hawkins (The Darkness) – guitar\n*Brian May (Queen) – guitar\n*Roger Taylor – drums (Queen)\n*Phil Collins – drums (Genesis)\n*Ron Mael – keyboards (Sparks)\n\nVocals:\n*Tim Wheeler (Ash)\n*Daniel Bedingfield\n*Natasha Bedingfield\n*Bono (U2)\n*Busted\n*Chris Martin (Coldplay)\n*Dido – performed separately from a studio in Melbourne\n*Dizzee Rascal – the only artist to add lyrics to the song\n*Ms Dynamite\n*Skye Edwards (Morcheeba)\n*Estelle\n*Neil Hannon (The Divine Comedy)\n*Justin Hawkins (The Darkness)\n*Jamelia\n*Tom Chaplin (Keane)\n*Tim Rice-Oxley (Keane)\n*Beverley Knight\n*Lemar\n*Shaznay Lewis (formerly of All Saints)\n*Katie Melua\n*Róisín Murphy (Moloko)\n*Feeder\n*Snow Patrol\n*Rachel Stevens\n*Joss Stone\n*Sugababes\n*The Thrills\n*Turin Brakes\n*Robbie Williams – performed separately from a studio in Los Angeles\n*Will Young\n*Russell Mael (Sparks)\n*Fran Healy (Travis)\nQuestion:\nIn what year was Band-Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas the UK Christmas chart-topping record (bonus point each for the years of reissue success by Band Aid II and Band Aid 20)?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nThe Birds (story)\n\"The Birds\" is a novelette by British writer Daphne du Maurier, first published in her 1952 collection The Apple Tree. It is the story of a farmhand, his family, and his community that are attacked by flocks of birds and seabirds in kamikaze missions. The story is set in du Maurier's native Cornwall shortly after the end of the Second World War. By the end of the story it has become clear that all of Britain is under aerial assault.\n\nThe story was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds, released in 1963, the same year that The Apple Tree was reprinted as The Birds and Other Stories. In 2009, Irish playwright Conor McPherson adapted the story for the stage at Dublin's Gate Theatre.\n\nBackground\n\nThe author saw a man ploughing a field while seagulls were wheeling and diving above him and composed a story of these birds growing hostile and attacking.   Inspired by her quiet, rural home town in Cornwall, the story is thought to be a metaphor for the attacks on London during World War II, or The Blitz in particular.\n\nRadio and TV dramatisations\n\nThe story has been dramatised for radio and TV on several occasions, including:\n*Episode 838 of Lux Radio Theater on 20 July 1953 with Herbert Marshall\n*Episode 217 of Escape on 10 July 1954 with Ben Wright and Virginia Gregg\n*Episode 240 (final show in the series) of CBS-TV series Danger on 31 May 1955 with Michael Strong and Betty Lou Holland\n*BBC Afternoon Theatre on 20 November 1974 with Howard Goorney, Chris Harris, and Elizabeth Boxer  \n*A three part BBC Radio 4 Extra adaptation, read by Charlie Barnecut, first broadcast 23 April 2008 \n*An adaptation by Melissa Murray, for BBC Radio 4's The Friday Play, first broadcast on 30 April 2010 \n\nPlot summary \n\nIn a small Cornish seaside town in early December, there is a sudden cold snap. A wounded war veteran on military pension, Nat Hocken, is working part-time for a farm owner when he notices a large number of birds behaving strangely along the peninsula where his family lives. He attributes this to the sudden arrival of winter. That night, he hears a tapping on his bedroom window and encounters a bird that pecks his hand, causing him to bleed. As the night progresses he encounters more birds, especially those flocking into his children's room, but the birds leave at dawn. Nat reassures his wife that they were restless because of a sudden change in the weather.\n\nThe next day, Nat tells his fellow workers about the night's events, but they give his story no importance. As Nat later walks to the beach to dispose of dead birds, he notices what appear to be whitecaps on the sea, but it is actually a great line of seagulls waiting for the tide to rise. When Nat arrives home, he and his family hear over the radio that birds are attacking all over Britain, presumably because of the unnatural weather. Nat decides to board up the windows and chimneys of his house. He notices more birds, including the gulls, above the sea waiting for the tide.\n\nNat rushes to pick up his daughter, Jill, from the school bus stop to keep her safe. On his way back Nat spots his boss, Mr. Trigg, who has a car, and persuades him to give Jill a lift home. Mr. Trigg cheerfully professes to be unfazed by the announcements and plans on shooting at the birds for fun. He invites Nat to come along, but Nat rejects Mr. Trigg's offer and continues home, believing that hunting them would be futile. Just before he reaches home, the gulls descend, attacking him with their beaks. Luckily, Nat manages to reach the cottage door with only minor injuries.\n\nSoon, massive flocks of birds attack. A national emergency is declared on BBC Radio, and people are told not to leave their homes.  Then, due to the \"unprecedented nature of the emergency\", the BBC announces that is going silent for the night and will resume broadcasting the next morning.  For safety, Nat brings the family into the kitchen for the night. During their dinner they hear what sounds like gunfire from airplanes overhead, followed by the sound of the planes crashing. The attacks die down, and Nat calculates that the birds will only attack at high tide.\n\nThe next morning, wireless broadcasts do not resume and the radio is silent.  The tide recedes, and Nat sets out to obtain supplies from his neighbours. He finds piles of dead birds around the houses; those still alive peer at him from afar. Nat walks to the farm where he is employed, only to find Mr. Trigg, Mrs. Trigg and their workman, Jim, dead. Later he finds the postman's body by the road; soon he comes to the realization that his neighbors have all been killed by the birds.\n\nNat returns home with the supplies but soon the birds attack once again. As if facing a firing squad, Nat smokes his last cigarette, then throws the empty pack into the fire and watches it burn.\nQuestion:\nThe Alfred Hitchcock films Rebecca and The Birds were based on novels by which author?\nAnswer:\n",

It is run at Newbury over a distance of about 3 miles and 2½ furlongs (5,331 metres), and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late November or early December.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was established in 1957, and it was initially staged at Cheltenham. The winner of the inaugural running, Mandarin, was owned by Peggy Hennessy, a member of the family which founded Hennessy, the race's sponsoring company. It was transferred to Newbury in 1960, and it was won by Mandarin for a second time in 1961. The race's second running was won by Taxidermist, ridden by the amateur rider John Lawrence, later Lord Oaksey, who was the breeder and part-owner of the 2011 winner, Carruthers. \n\nThe race's association with Hennessy has continued throughout its history, and this now represents British racing's longest commercial sponsorship. The record was previously held by the Whitbread Gold Cup, which was first run seven months before the \"Hennessy\", and which was sponsored by Whitbread until 2001.\n\nThe Hennessy Gold Cup has been won by eight horses which have also achieved victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. The most recent of these is Bobs Worth, the winner of the latter race in 2013.\n\nMany Clouds became the first horse to win both the Hennessy Gold Cup and the Grand National, in 2014 and 2015 respectively.\n\nRecords\n\nMost successful horse (2 wins):\n* Mandarin – 1957, 1961\n* Arkle – 1964, 1965\n* Denman – 2007, 2009\n\nLeading jockey (3 wins):\n* Willie Robinson – Mandarin (1961), Mill House (1963), Man of the West (1968)\n\nLeading trainer (7 wins):\n* Fulke Walwyn – Mandarin (1957, 1961), Taxidermist (1958), Mill House (1963), Man of the West (1968), Charlie Potheen (1972), Diamond Edge (1981)\n\nWinners\n\n* Weights given in stones and pounds; Amateur jockeys indicated by \"Mr\".\n\n Be My Royal finished first in 2002, but he was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for a banned substance.\nQuestion:\nAt which English racecourse would you see the 'Hennessy Gold Cup'?\nAnswer:\n",

During the 19th cent. British art was poorly represented in the national collections. The 1840s and 1850s saw a number of important bequests to the nation, including that of sculptor  Sir  Francis Chantrey , who left his fortune for the purchase of ‘Works of Fine Art … [by] artists resident in Great Britain ’, and the enormous Turner bequest, which the National Gallery was unable to house adequately. In 1890 the sugar magnate  Henry  Tate gave 60 modern English paintings to the National Gallery provided that a gallery was made available. The offer was twice withdrawn as arguments delayed the provision of a suitable site and funding for a new gallery. Eventually the government offered the prison site at Millbank, London, and the Tate Gallery opened in 1897.\nWealthy benefactors have continued to aid expansion; in 1987 the Turner bequest was finally housed as the artist intended, in the extension funded by the Clore Foundation. The Bankside power station was converted into the Tate Modern, opened in 2000, and the original gallery was renamed Tate Britain.\nJune  Cochrane\nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\nMLA\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.\nCopyright The Columbia University Press\nTate Gallery, London, originally the National Gallery of British Art.

It was extended by another gift of Tate's in 1899, and in 1910 the Turner wing was completed, the gift of Sir Joseph Duveen. A gallery of modern foreign art was added in 1916, and three new galleries for foreign art and one for the works of John Singer Sargent were opened in 1926. The museum was damaged in World War II but reopened in 1949. In 1987 the Clore Gallery was opened to display the gallery's collection of J. M. W. Turner works, which is the most extensive in the world. Now renamed the Tate Britain, the complex is devoted to British art.

    "input": "Passage:\nTomato: Tigerella Blossom End Rot - Plant Guide\n[X] Close\nBlossom End Rot\nThis is mainly a problem on the fruit of tomatoes and peppers and manifests itself as sunken brown and leathery patches on the blossom end of the first few fruit of the season. These patches may eventually turn black and rot, as the damaged skin facilitates the entrance of rot-causing organisms. Blossom End Rot is a physiological problem rather than a disease and is caused by a lack of calcium in the plant. Calcium is rarely deficient in the soil because it is commonly added to adjust pH, so there is usually some other factor at work. Most often it is due to irregular watering inhibiting calcium absorption, but it can also be caused by too much nitrogen or magnesium.\nTo reduce the incidence of Blossom End Rot, keep the soil evenly moist and well mulched. Don’t give the plants too much nitrogen. If your soil is acidic then lime it, as this will add calcium too. Foliar feeding with seaweed or compost tea is a quick way to supply extra calcium. Indeterminate varieties are less commonly affected by Blossom End Rot than determinate varieties. You should remove affected fruit immediately, so the plant doesn’t waste energy on them (they won’t be of any use anyway).\nImage: David B.

    "input": "Passage:\nCostermonger\nCostermonger, coster, or costard is a street seller of fruit and vegetables, in London and other British towns. Costermongers were ubiquitous in mid-Victorian England, and some are still found in markets. As usual with street-sellers, they would use a loud sing-song cry or chant to attract attention. The costermonger's cart might be stationary at a market stall, or mobile (horse-drawn or wheelbarrow).  The term is derived from the words costard (a now extinct medieval variety of large, ribbed apple) and monger (seller).\n\nCosters met a need for rapid food distribution from the central markets (e.g., Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish). Their membership as a coster was signalled by their large neckerchief, known as a kingsman, tied round their necks. Their hostility towards the police was legendary. \n\nThe term is now often used to describe hawkers in general;  sometimes a distinction is made between the two: a costermonger sells from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, while a hawker carries his wares in a basket.\n\nHistory\n\nCostermongers have existed in London since at least the 16th century, when they were mentioned by Shakespeare and Marlowe. They probably were most numerous during the Victorian era, when there were said to be over 30,000 in 1860. They gained a fairly unsavoury reputation for their \"low habits, general improvidence, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar slang language\" (John Camden Hotten, The Slang Dictionary, 1859). Costers were notoriously competitive: respected \"elder statespeople\" in the costermonger community were elected as pearly kings and queens to keep the peace between rival costermongers. \n\nHowever, crimes such as theft were actually rare among costermongers themselves, especially in an open market where they tended to look out for one another. Even common thieves preferred to prey on shop owners rather than costers, who were inclined to dispense street justice. The costers' animosity towards the police was extreme:\n\nThe activities and lifestyles of 19th century costermongers are comprehensively documented in London Labour and the London Poor, a four volume collection of erudite and well-researched articles by Henry Mayhew. Mayhew describes a Saturday night in the New Cut, a street in Lambeth, south of the river: \n\nSuch was London in the 1840s; but by the end of the 19th century, the costermongers were in gradual decline. They did not disappear as mobile street-sellers until about 1960, when the few that remained took pitches in local markets. They were portrayed in the music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood and Gus Elen. In The Forsyte Saga, Swithin Forsyte is driving Irene Forsyte in his carriage through the streets of London in 1886 and a costermonger (the \"ruffian\") and his girlfriend are riding alongside in their donkey cart, which is overturned in traffic. The anti-hero of Look Back in Anger (1956) by playwright John Osborne is a coster who sells sweets from a stall. The film version depicts aspects of the everyday culture of street markets, such as racial prejudice, irate customers and abusive regulatory officials.\n\nCoster style\n\nBetty May spoke of the \"coster\" style and atmosphere in London around 1900 in her autobiography Tiger Woman: My Story in 1929: \"I am often caught with a sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for the girls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers, like clouds in a wind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointed boots in which they took such pride. I adored the swagger and the showiness of it all.\"May, Betty. (1929) Tiger Woman: My Story. (2014 reprint) London: Duckworth. ISBN 978-0715648551\n\nLegal standing\n\nThe costermonger's trade in London is subject to regulation by law, under the administration of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. If the pitch is stationary, by-laws of local councils also apply. Legislation exists under clause six of the Metropolitan Streets Act 1867, which deals with obstruction by goods to pavements (sidewalks) and streets. There are various modern amendments.\nQuestion:\nWhat does a costermonger sell?\nAnswer:\n",

And apparently, that's exactly what a type of lemur known as an aye-aye likes to do. A lot. A new study out of Dartmouth College figured out that the little prosimian likes to gobble up food with the highest alcohol content – but not necessarily for the reasons you think.\nThe aye-aye is the world's largest nocturnal primate and belongs to the group known as prosimians, which also includes the slow loris and bush baby. It is only found on the island of Madagascar and has one long finger that it uses to tap on trees to get grubs scrambling around. It then listens for the insects moving beneath the bark and uses the same long finger to dig them out, making it something of a mammalian woodpecker.\nUnlike other prosimians though, the aye-aye has a genetic mutation in common with humans and great apes that allows it to metabolize alcohol 40 times faster than animals lacking the mutation, meaning that it can take in some hooch and not get too terribly drunk from it. Because alcohol is not only a way to make bad decisions on Tinder, but also a fairly decent source of calories (as any college freshman knows), the Dartmouth team wanted to find out if the aye-aye actually preferred more alcohol in its meals – which it can find in the wild in the form of fermented fruit.\nSo, in a study that seems like it was a lot of fun for both the lemur and the humans, they created a bit of booze by fermenting a nectar-simulating solution of sucrose. During a visit to the Duke University Lemur Center, they placed dishes containing the boozy brew on a table outside, and let two aye-ayes, named Morticia and Merlin go to town. They also invited a slow loris named Dharma to the party.\nThe concentration of alcohol in the dishes varied, but only got as high as five percent, to simulate the alcohol concentrations that might be found in fermented fruit in the wild.\nThe researchers found that they aye-ayes showed a clear preference for the dishes with the most alcohol and that they \"continued to probe the containers with the highest concentrations long after they were emptied, suggesting that they wanted more,\" according to a Dartmouth report. Dharma too seemed to really prefer the high-hooch nectar, although the report says that the loris' behavior wasn't tracked enough to be statistically significant.\n\"None of the animals exhibited signs of impaired coordination or behavior, as intoxication was not part of the study,\" says Dartmouth. While that makes the study authors party poopers, it does point out that the animals are likely seeking out alcohol for its caloric — rather than buzz-inducing — properties. Then again, the critters were trying to get more out of the containers, so who knows how long the drinking session might have gone on.\nThe finding is a bit puzzling for the researchers because it's odd that the aye-aye developed a genetic mutation for rapid alcohol metabolism considering that its primary diet consists of grubs. One reason for this might be because the animals can devote up to 20 percent of their feeding time gulping down nectar from a \"traveler's tree,\" a plant specific to Madagascar.\nBeing that the aye-aye shares the same genetic mutation with humans, the study authors feel that their work could shed light on the booze-consuming habits of our early ancestors.\n\"This project has definitely fueled my interest in human evolution\" said Samuel Gochman, one of the study authors. \"Our results support the idea that fermented foods were important in the diets of our ancestors.\"\nQuestion:\nTo which group of primates do Aye Ayes belong?\nAnswer:\n",

It was an essential contribution to the development of modern day skyscrapers.\nThe First System for Manufacturing Steel\nAn American, William Kelly, initially held a patent for \"a system of air blowing the carbon out of pig iron,\" a method of steel production known as the pneumatic process. Air was blown through molten pig iron to oxidize and remove unwanted impurities.\nThis was Bessemer’s starting point. When Kelly went bankrupt, Bessemer – who had been working on a similar process for making steel – bought his patent. Bessemer patented \"a decarbonization process utilizing a blast of air\" in 1855.\nModern Steel\nModern steel is made using technology based on Bessemer's process. On the making of the first steel ingot, Bessemer said:\n\"I well remember how anxiously I awaited the blowing of the first 7-cwt. charge of pig iron. I had engaged an ironfounder's furnace attendant to manage the cupola and the melting of the charge. When his metal was nearly all melted, he came to me and said hurriedly, \"Where be going to put the metal, maister?\" I said, \"I want you to run it by a gutter into that little furnace,\" pointing to the converter, \"from which you have just raked out all the fuel, and then I shall blow cold air through it to make it hot.\"\nThe man looked at me in a way in which surprise and pity for my ignorance seemed curiously blended, and he said, \"It will soon be all of a lump.\" Notwithstanding this prediction, the metal was run in, and I awaited with much impatience the result. The first element attacked by the atmospheric oxygen is the silicon, generally present in pig iron to the extent of 1 1/2 to 2 percent; it is the white metallic substance of which flint is the acid silicate. Its combustion furnishes a great deal of heat, but it is very undemonstrative, a few sparks and hot gases only indicating the fact that something is going quietly on.\nBut after an interval of 10 or 12 minutes, when the carbon contained in grey pig iron to the extent of about 3 percent is seized on by the oxygen, a voluminous white flame is produced which rushes out of the openings provided for its escape from the upper chamber, and it brilliantly illuminates the whole space around. This chamber proved a perfect cure for the rush of slags and metal from the upper central opening of the first converter. I watched with some anxiety for the expected cessation of the flame as the carbon gradually burnt out. It took place almost suddenly, and thus indicated the entire decarburisation of the metal.\nThe furnace was then tapped, when out rushed a limpid stream of incandescent malleable iron, almost too brilliant for the eye to rest upon. It was allowed to flow vertically into the parallel undivided ingot mould. Then came the question, would the ingot shrink enough, and the cold iron mould expand enough, to allow the ingot to be pushed out? An interval of eight or 10 minutes was allowed, and then, on the application of hydraulic force to the ram, the ingot rose entirely out of the mould and stood there ready for removal.\"\nBessemer was knighted in 1879 for his contributions to science. The \"Bessemer Process\" for mass-producing steel was named after him.\nRobert Mushet is credited with inventing tungsten steel in 1868, and Henry Brearly invented stainless steel in 1916.\nQuestion:\nWhich metal is produced by the Bessemer Process?\nAnswer:\n",

Not all confederation members are individually members of FIFA. Map by Evan Centanni, based on work by EOZyo ( source ).\nFootball/soccer fans around the world are tuning in tonight for the  beginning of the month-long FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

Subscribe now !\nHow many countries participate in FIFA?\nThere are currently 209 national football teams with official FIFA membership, which is required to compete for qualification in the World Cup. FIFA members are divided into six continental confederations that preside over competitions within each region (see map above).*\nYou might have noticed that 209 is more than the number of actual independent countries in the world . After all, the United Nations only recognizes 195. That's because, much like the Olympics , FIFA used to allow dependent territories to apply for membership. Now they only admit recognized independent countries (with a few exceptions), but teams that became members in the past are allowed to stay on regardless of their sovereignty status.\nFIFA members that aren't independent countries\nToday there are 18 dependent territories with FIFA-eligible national football teams:\nClick to enlarge: FIFA members that aren't independent countries. By Evan Centanni, from public domain base map ( source ).\nNorth America & the Caribbean\n  Tahiti (France)\nBy tradition, each of the four \"countries\" making up the UK also has a separate team, despite them not being independent themselves:\n  Wales\nAlso as in the Olympics, disputed states Palestine and Taiwan (known in sports as \" Chinese Taipei \") are included as special cases without the requirement for fully-recognized independence. In fact, Palestine is now treated as an independent country by the UN , but that wasn't yet the case when it was first admitted to FIFA in 1998.\nChanges since 2010\nSince the last World Cup in 2010, one new country has joined FIFA: South Sudan . This East African nation only became independent in 2011, after the 2010 World Cup in South Africa was already over. It's now fully eligible, but still wasn't able to enter in this year's Cup because qualification matches began just before it joined.\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands Antilles were eligible for the last time in 2010, though they didn't manage to qualify for the World Cup finals. Later that same year, the Dutch dependency was split into several separate territories, and its FIFA membership was inherited only by the largest island, Curaçao , which entered for the 2014 Cup but again didn't qualify. Two of the other island territories, Bonaire and Sint Maarten , formed their own national teams but have not been accepted as FIFA members. However, they have been allowed to participate in their relevant continental organization, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF).\nWhich countries aren't members of FIFA?\nEven though quite a few dependent territories are FIFA members, there are still a few fully independent countries that aren't eligible:\nClick to enlarge: Countries and territories without FIFA membership. Dark Blue: national team not recognized by FIFA; Light Blue: no known national team. Map by Evan Centanni, from public domain base map ( source ).\nEurope\n  Tuvalu\nThe Marshall Islands are the only independent, UN-recognized country that don't have any national team at all. All the others on the list do have teams (yes, even Vatican City !), but are not members of FIFA. This means they're not eligible even to enter into qualifying matches for the World Cup, though Kiribati and Tuvalu do participate as associate members in the relevant continental organization, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC).\nEven though Palestine and Taiwan managed to secure membership, other partially unrecognized countries haven't been able to get into FIFA.

Out of the 208 countries eligible at the time of qualification (remember, South Sudan missed out), there are just 32 countries qualifying for this year's World Cup finals in Brazil. One of them, Bosnia and Herzegovina , is in the finals for the first time after gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. See below for a full map of eligible and qualifying national teams in this year's Cup:\nBlue = countries qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup; orange = countries eliminated in the qualifying rounds; black = countries that didn't enter; gray = countries that weren't members when qualification began.

The Asian Football Confederation also includes Australia, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands (usually considered part of Oceania), while Caribbean countries, including South America's Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, are grouped with North and Central America. As in the Olympics , Israel is a member of the European confederation despite its location on the Asian continent. Turkey, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are also grouped with Europe but located mostly in Asia.\nQuestion:\nWhat de-facto independent country does China claim ownership of?\nAnswer:\n",

Many feel that it was Sibelius rather than Mahler who was the last master in the grand Beethoven symphonic tradition.\nLife and Music\nAlthough Sibelius displayed an affinity for music from an early age, he was hardly a prodigy. He didn't start formal piano lessons until he was nine, although it was the violin that fired his enthusiasm.\nHe became obsessed with the idea of becoming a world-class virtuoso. His failure to do so struck a big emotional blow - he got as far as an audition with the Vienna Philharmonic.\nSibelius received a thorough training in composition, but what really set him on the road as a composer was the Berlin premiere of his conductor-composer friend Robert Kajanu's Aino Symphony.\nThe fearsomely nationalistic young Finn's immediate response was a massive five-movement symphonic poem entitled Kullervo composed in 1892, the year he married Aino Jarnefelt. This was swiftly followed by En Saga, the Karelia Suite, a series of four orchestral Legends (including the much-loved Swan of Tuonela) and Finlandia.\nBetween 1899 and 1926 Sibelius composed seven symphonies which tantalisingly balance to varying degrees his Classicist roots and Romantic inclinations.\nUntil the outbreak of the First World War, Sibelius was in demand throughout Europe as a conductor.\nSibelius's last major work was the orchestral tone-poem Tapiola, which points towards the possibility of a new period of creative mastery. However, with over 30 years of his life remaining, Sibelius virtually laid his composing pen to rest.\nFor several years he worked secretively on an Eighth Symphony, but this was later consigned to the fire.\nHe remains one of the few 20th-century composers to have become a legend within his own lifetime.\nDid you know?\nSibelius was actually given the first name Johan when he was born; that is the Finnish version of the English name John. But when he found out his uncle had turned his name into Jean, which is the French version of John, Sibelius decided to do the same.\nSibelius: 15 facts about the great composer\nToday his name is used for music composing software, but the Finnish composer Sibelius deserves our attention – not least for his Finlandia and Violin Concerto.\nQuestion:\nHow many symphonies did Jean Sibelius compose?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nGuillemot\nGuillemots is the common name for several species of seabird in the auk family (part of the order Charadriiformes).  In British use, the term comprises two genera: Uria and Cepphus. In North America the Uria species are called \"murres\" and only the Cepphus species are called \"guillemots\". This word of French origin apparently derives from a form of the name William, cf. . \n\nThe two living species of Uria, together with the razorbill, dovekie and the extinct great auk, make up the tribe Alcini.  They have distinctly white bellies, thicker and longer bills than Cepphus, and form very dense colonies on cliffs during the reproductive season. \n\nThe three living species of Cepphus form a tribe of their own: Cepphini.   They are smaller than the Uria species and have black bellies, rounder heads and bright red feet.\n\nIn July 2013, Dr Steven Portugal from the Royal Veterinary College demonstrated that when water touches the eggs, it forms into droplets rather than running off; in other words, guillemot eggs are water-repellant and self-cleaning.\n\nSystematics\n\nUria\n\n*Common murre or common guillemot, Uria aalge\n*Thick-billed murre or Brünnich's guillemot, Uria lomvia\n\nSome prehistoric species are also known:\n\n* Uria bordkorbi (Monterey or Sisquoc Late Miocene of Lompoc, USA)\n* Uria affinis (Late Pleistocene of E USA)—possibly a subspecies of U. lomvia\n* Uria paleohesperis\n\nU. brodkorbi is the only known occurrence of the Alcini tribe in the temperate to subtropical Pacific, except for the very fringe of the range of U. aalge.\n\nCepphus\n\n* Black guillemot or tystie,  Cepphus grylle\n* Pigeon guillemot,  Cepphus columba\n* Spectacled guillemot,  Cepphus carbo\n\nAs in other genera of auks, fossils of prehistoric forms of Cepphus have been found:\n\n* Cepphus olsoni (San Luis Rey River Late Miocene—Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. columba (Lawrence Canyon Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. grylle (San Diego Late Pliocene, W USA)\n\nThe latter two resemble the extant species, but because of the considerable distance in time or space from their current occurrence, they may represent distinct species.\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird is a guillemot?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nThe Four Seasons Restaurant\nThe Four Seasons is a New American cuisine restaurant in New York City located at 99 East 52nd Street, in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan.  The restaurant is owned by the Bronfman family, Alex von Bidder, and Julian Niccolini.   \n\nOpened in 1959, the Four Seasons is associated with a number of milestone firsts in the hospitality industry.  The Four Seasons is credited with introducing the idea of seasonally-changing menus to America. It was the first destination restaurant to print its menus in English.  The Four Seasons was also the first restaurant in the US to cook using fresh, wild mushrooms.  \nIn June 2015, Aby Rosen, owner of the Seagram Building, announced that the restaurant's lease would not be extended. A new location at 280 Park Avenue was selected and a lease was signed. The Seagram Building location closed after dinner service on July 16, 2016, and the Four Seasons will move to Park Avenue. \n\nAwards and honors\n\nThe restaurant itself has been widely praised, winning the James Beard Award in 1999. The restaurant is known as much for its clientele as its food, with its Midtown location making it convenient for power lunches.\n\nDesign \n\nThe restaurant's interior, which was designed by the building's architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, has remained almost unchanged since construction in 1959. The restaurant was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as an interior landmark in 1989. \n\nOver a hundred items of serviceware were designed by L. Garth Huxtable and Ada Louise Huxtable, everything from champagne glasses to bread trays.   Today they and all of the Four Seasons Restaurant's furniture are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nFor the celebration of the restaurant's 50th anniversary, The Four Seasons hired Manhattan Architect Belmont Freeman FAIA for a full restoration of the ladies' lounge.\n\nIn popular culture \n\nIn 2009, The Four Seasons was the subject of a mockumentary and a children's book published in August 2009.  \n\nArt \n\nThe artist Mark Rothko was engaged to paint a series of works for the restaurant in 1958. Accepting the commission, he secretly resolved to create \"something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room.\" Observing the restaurant's pretentious atmosphere upon his return from a trip to Europe, Rothko abandoned the project altogether, returned his advance and kept the paintings for himself. The final series was dispersed and now hangs in three locations: London’s Tate Gallery, Japan’s Kawamura Memorial Museum and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.  During the period in which Rothko worked on his murals, the Four Seasons rented Jackson Pollock's masterpiece Blue Poles from its then-owner, art collector Ben Heller.   John Logan's Tony Award-winning 2010 play Red dramatizes Rothko's time working on the Seagram Murals.\n\nFrom 1975 until 1985 four paintings by Ronnie Landfield from the collection of Philip Johnson   were installed on the wall that had been initially planned for the Mark Rothko commission.   In 1985 the artist James Rosenquist was commissioned to install a permanent mural on the wall; the Landfield paintings were returned to Philip Johnson. A major Richard Lippold sculpture is installed in the Front Bar, which hangs from the ceiling.\n\nThe large curtain designed by Pablo Picasso for the Ballets Russes ballet Le Tricorne (1919) has been hung between the Grill Room and the Pool Room since the restaurant opened. The curtain is a portion of a Picasso tapestry used as a prop for the ballet that was purchased in 1957 by Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of the founder of Seagram, and installed in the entryway to the restaurant for its opening in 1959. In 2014, the curtain was removed permanently from that location, and is currently in the New-York Historical Society.  Controversy over the plans to remove the curtain existed and the Museum of Modern Art offered storage space for it if the outcome is removal.\n\nIn addition to the works on permanent public display there are other works and continuously revolving exhibitions in the dining rooms and the 52nd Street entrance walls which have included works by Joan Miró, paintings by Frank Stella, Ronnie Landfield, Robert Indiana, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, amongst several others.\nQuestion:\nWhich artist painted the 'Seagram Murals' which were originally commissioned by the Four Seasons Hotel in New York in 1958?\nAnswer:\n",

Spark's fiction is characterized by the use of certain techniques which give her often short novels a feeling of complexity and depth. Her new novel, Aiding and Abetting, is true to form short in length and long on style. In this quirky tale of murder, blackmail and false identities, Spark widens the book's scope by using an omniscient third-person narrator and unexpected time and place shifts. These techniques, coupled with her witty, understated way of revealing unusual events, makes Aiding and Abetting a delightfully strange and surprising tale.  The inspiring \"spark\" for this story was a real-life upper-class crime story that caused a sensation in the British press. As Spark tells us in her opening Note to Readers, the real-life seventh Earl of Lucan disappeared in 1974 when he fled from charges of murder (oops he killed his children's nanny by mistake, thinking she was his wife) and attempted murder (oops again he tried once more to kill his wife but she survived his attack). Aiding and Abetting is a fiction, a fabrication of Lucan's life on the lam more of a whimsical \"where'd he go?\" than a hard-boiled \"whodunit.\"  Still, there is plenty to keep us guessing. Spark keeps the \"who?\" question alive throughout much of the story by having two nearly identical \"Lucans\" surface, each claiming to be the genuine article and each claiming patient-doctor privilege in his relationship with the psychiatrist, Hildegard Wolf, an alluring, enigmatic, former fake stigmatic from Bavaria.  These three less-than-honorable characters play cat and mouse games from start to finish. In the hands of a less-venturous novelist, they would probably provide enough entertaining, problematic entanglements by themselves, but Spark (now in her 80s) is not one to shy from a twist or a complication she'll throw a new character into the fray or pull one out of the past on a moment's notice keeping your wheels spinning. Aiding and Abetting may be unconventional in structure, it may break some rules, but you will find the pages turning quickly as you try to puzzle out this Rubik's Cube of a novel.\nLinda Stankard is a writer/actor living in Middle Tennessee who has broken a few rules herself, though with less literary acclaim.\nQuestion:\n'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' is a 1961 novel by which author?\nAnswer:\n",

After winning a tennis scholarship to UCLA, Ashe was taken under the wing of tennis star Pancho Gonzales, who recognized the young player’s potential. In 1968, Ashe became the first black man to win the U.S. Open. Two years later, he captured the Australian Open for his second Grand Slam title. Over the next seven years, Ashe won his share of tournaments, but no more majors, and, frustrated, he set his sights on victory at Wimbledon, one of the most celebrated championships in tennis.\nArthur Ashe was 31 years old in 1975, and seemingly well past his prime, so his advancement to the 1975 Wimbledon finals came as somewhat of a surprise to the tennis establishment. While Ashe’s best finishes at Wimbledon had been losses in the semi-finals in 1968 and 1969, his opponent, the brash 22-year-old Jimmy Connors, was the defending Wimbledon champion. In their three previous meetings, Connors had handled Ashe easily. Furthermore, Connors was coming off an impressive semi-final win against Roscoe Tanner, whose intimidating serve observers called the hardest hitting ever at Wimbledon.\nThough many thought he didn’t have a chance, Ashe formulated a game plan for the match: hit nothing hard. He planned to serve strongly and then give Connors nothing but “junk” as Ashe himself described it. Connors won the first game of the first set, but then dropped the rest of the set in just 20 minutes, 6-1. Although Connors won just one game off Ashe in the second set, he took the third set 7-5. His confidence restored, Connors strutted around the court, while Ashe closed his eyes between sets, concentrating on the moment at hand. Finally, with the shocked crowd cheering him on, Ashe finished Connors off in the fourth set, 6-4.\nAshe retired from competitive tennis in 1980 after suffering a heart attack. For his career, he won 51 tournaments. In retirement, Ashe wrote the three-volume book A Hard Road to Glory, first published in 1988, which detailed the struggle of black athletes in America. In 1983, after double-bypass surgery, Ashe was infected with HIV during a blood transfusion. After revealing his disease to the world in 1992, he set about educating the public about HIV and AIDS. He died of AIDS-related complications on February 6, 1993. In 1997, the U.S. Open’s new home court was named Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nWho is the only black man to win a singles title at Wimbledon?\nAnswer:\n",

Sarah Palin , who was the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, mistakenly referred to the White House as being located at \"1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n\"Don't retreat. You reload with truth, which I know is an endangered species at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue, anyway truth,\" Palin said. \"The media's favorite president. He just can't stop telling lies.\"\nWATCH: Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin Hold Tea Party Rally\nIt doesn't appear that a 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue NW actually exists-but the closest thing is the Willard Hotel, which is located at 1401 Pennsylvania Ave NW.\nAt one point in the speech, Palin also gave President Obama a salute with a Styrofoam cup, playing off the president's \"latte salute\" to Marines as he walked off Marine One earlier this week.\n\"Our honored military when we talk about these nationals security issues, our honored military. On behalf of all Americans who do support you and we honor you. We respect you. On behalf of all Americans who feel like I do, to your commander in chief, well we then will salute him,\" Palin said as she pulled out a Styrofoam cup and waved it in the air. \"Still hasn't learned how to salute our Marines.\"\nJoin the Discussion\nQuestion:\nWhat building is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?\nAnswer:\n",

POWERS | TIMES STAFF WRITER\nAlexander Dubcek, the silent symbol of Czechoslovakia's failed 1968 attempt to alter the hard-line course of Moscow-dictated communism, died Saturday at age 70.\nDubcek, who had been hospitalized since a car accident Sept. 1, died at a Prague, Czechoslovakia, hospital from \"failure of vital organs,\" the official state news agency CSTK reported.\nFor 21 years after a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that put down the \"Prague Spring,\" Dubcek lived in a sort of internal exile that roughly paralleled the fortunes of his compatriots: He was comfortable enough, but voiceless, in a villa outside his native Bratislava.\nNow and then, when he attended a concert, his neighbors and admirers would rise to applaud him, an act of civil disobedience on the part of the public showing that his memory--and the memory of 1968--was still alive among Czechoslovaks.\nIt was still alive in 1989, when throngs gathered in Prague's Wenceslaus Square, sensing that communism was finally on the run in Eastern Europe. The crowd chanted Dubcek's name along with that of Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright who had come to symbolize the new Czechoslovak opposition.\nDubcek was always a believer in the socialist ideal. Born in 1921 in the Slovakian town of Uhrovec, near Topolcany, he grew up in Bratislava, the provincial capital. He joined the Communist Party when he was 18 years old and his country was occupied by Nazi forces. He was wounded twice fighting with Communist partisan units against the Nazis.\nAfter the war he went to Moscow, and he graduated in 1958 from Moscow's Communist Party Academy, a training ground for up-and-coming apparatchiks from throughout the Soviet Bloc. He returned to Bratislava and rose to become first secretary of the Slovak Communist Party.\nBut by the late 1960s, the Czechoslovak party was in quiet turmoil, with a younger generation of Communists in revolt against 15 years of Stalinist-style rule under the direction of party leader Antonin Novotny, who made no secret of his contempt for Nikita S. Khrushchev's attempts to ease the centralization of Communist Party power in the Soviet Union.\nThe reformers ousted Novotny in January, 1968, and chose Dubcek as their party leader. He was no firebrand reformer but was chosen as a compromise candidate, acceptable to both reformers and hard-liners.\nDubcek's desire to create \"socialism with a human face\" and the nation's desire for change triggered six months of debate and reform in 1968 that came to be known as the \"Prague Spring.\"\nCzechoslovakia's reformers sought an overhaul of the legal system, civil liberties guarantees and a more responsive system of economic planning. None of the goals, in themselves, espoused an end to the Communist system, but Moscow's leaders saw that the reformers' \"action program\" received wide public support and thus amounted to a clear threat to the Soviet system in neighboring countries.\nDuring the night of Aug. 20-21, five Warsaw Pact armies invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia. Security forces arrested Dubcek and other party leaders and flew them to Moscow. Party leaders in Prague refused to recognize the Soviet-imposed government, and after lengthy negotiations Dubcek was allowed to return home, still in his post as first secretary of the party.\nHe tried to salvage the \"action program\" of the reformers, but the atmosphere remained tense. A university student burned himself to death on Wenceslaus Square to protest the Soviet invasion, and a hostile crowd vandalized the offices of Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. In April, 1969, Dubcek was removed as party leader and given the largely ceremonial post of president of Parliament.\nEven that was not to last long. He was fired the following September and removed from the party's Central Committee. That December he was appointed ambassador to Turkey. Then in June, 1970, he was expelled from the Communist Party and brought home from Turkey. He was ejected from his seat in the Parliament's House of the People.\nDubcek then moved to Slovakia with his wife, Anna, and was given a menial job as a clerk in a forestry office.\nFrom then until 1987, when then-Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Czechoslovakia, Dubcek was kept under close surveillance. He was scarcely mentioned in the Czechoslovak press, except for the occasional historical denunciation of \"liberal\" trends in the socialist world. Foreign reporters were forbidden to visit him.\nAfter Gorbachev's rise to power in Moscow, however, the controls on Dubcek were relaxed. In 1988, on a visit to Italy, he indicated that he still held to his belief in the workability of a \"reformed\" communism, as exemplified by Gorbachev.\nQuestion:\nIn January 1968 who was chosen as leader of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nArdwick - Familypedia - Wikia\nArdwick | Familypedia | Fandom powered by Wikia\nArdwick is a district of Manchester in North West England , one mile east of the city centre .\nHistorically in Lancashire , by the mid-19th century Ardwick had grown from being a village into a pleasant and wealthy suburb of Manchester, but by the end of that century it had become heavily industrialised. [1] [2] When its industries later fell into decline then so did Ardwick itself, becoming one of the city's most deprived areas. Substantial development has taken place more recently in Ardwick and other areas of Manchester to reverse the decline, notably the construction of many facilities for the 2002 Commonwealth Games held nearby in Eastlands .\nIn the late 19th century Ardwick had many places of entertainment, but the only remnant of that history today is the Art Deco Manchester Apollo , a venue for pop and rock music concerts. [2]\nContents\nEdit\nPrior to the Industrial Revolution , Ardwick was a small village situated just outside Manchester in open countryside. The principal residents were the Birch family, one of whom was a Major General when Oliver Cromwell (briefly) instituted direct military rule.\nOne Samuel Birch was instrumental in providing a small chapel of ease , dedicated to St. Thomas, and consecrated in 1741. This soon expanded into a rather fine Georgian church, to which a fine brick campanile tower was added in the 1830s. It contained a very rare Samuel Green organ, the first in which the sharp keys were distinguished in black. There was also a memorial chapel to the dead of the First World War , chiefly men of the local territorial unit. Sadly, these have been removed, and the church is now used as offices for voluntary organisations.\nGrand terraces of regency houses (some of which still survive) were built either side of the church, and these were fronted by Ardwick Green , a private park for the residents, containing a pond. Similar housing developments to those around the Green took place along Higher Ardwick and the area known as the Polygon.\nEarly inhabitants included members the family of Sir Robert Peel . Charles Dickens drew many of his characters from life, and was a frequent visitor to Manchester. It is said that Dickens based the character of the crippled Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol on the invalid son of a friend who owned a cotton mill in Ardwick. [3]\nArdwick Cemetery was established in the 1830s as a prestigious place for fashionable burials. John Dalton , the chemist and physicist best known for his advocacy of atomic theory, is amongst those buried there. The cemetery has since been converted into a school playing field.\nIndustrial Revolution\nEdit\nDuring the 19th century, Ardwick became heavily industrialised and it was characterised by factories, railways and rows of back-to-back terraced houses being juxtaposed. Large numbers of Irish immigrants settled here, as they did throughout Manchester. Ardwick railway station is situated at a junction where the Manchester and Birmingham Railway , later the London and North Western Railway diverged from the line to Sheffield that became the Great Central Railway . Nicholls Hospital , a neo-gothic building that was later a school, was constructed on Hyde Road in the last quarter of the 19th century. More recently it has become the Nicholls Campus of the Manchester College . [4]\nThe railway bridge across Hyde Road was known by older residents as the \"Fenian Arch\".  On 18 September 1867 it was the scene of an attack upon a prison van carrying two Fenian prisoners to the former Belle Vue gaol (jail). One police officer was shot dead. Three Irishmen involved in the affray were caught, tried and executed. The men are referred to by their supporters as the so-called \" Manchester Martyrs \". [5]\nGeography and administration\nEdit\nThe village of Ardwick can be traced back to 1282, when it was known as Atherdwic and the road between Manchester and Stockport runs through it. From mediaeval times Ardwick was an independent township in the ancient parish of Manchester within the Salford hundred of Lancashire . It became part of the Borough of Manchester on the borough's creation in 1838. The historic boundary between Ardwick and Manchester was the River Medlock .\nPolitical divisions\nArdwick ward is represented by three councillors , Tom O'Callaghan, Bernard Priest and Mavis Smitheman, all members of the Labour Party . O'Callaghan (2004-05) and Smitheman (2008-09) have served as Lord Mayor of Manchester.\nPresent day\nEdit\nArdwick Green Park has recently been refurbished, and though the pond is no more, it still contains an interesting glacial erratic in the form of a boulder. There is also a cenotaph commemorating the 'Eighth Ardwicks', once a Territorial Army unit of the Manchester Regiment , whose former drill hall is still nearby. It was the old Volunteer Barracks, a fine Victorian castellated structure bearing the old volunteer motto \"Defence Not Defiance\". It is still in military use today.\nThe Manchester Apollo , a 1930s Art Deco theatre, is one of Ardwick's most famous landmarks: it was in use as a cinema (the ABC Ardwick) for many years and now plays host to national and international performing artists.\nExtensive demolition of dilapidated Victorian terraces took place around Ardwick during the 1960s. Some residents remained in the area in new council-owned houses and flats, while others were moved to overspill estates such as Hattersley .\nDemographics\n(According to 2011 census [6] )\nWhite British – 35.5%\nQuestion:\nDidsbury, Ardwick and Fallowfield are all areas of which British city?\nAnswer:\n",

This mark is added to a letter to signal a change in either the sound or meaning of a character. What is the additional name of this curious dot that hovers over the ninth and tenth lowercase letters of the English alphabet, and how did it get there?\nThe small distinguishing mark you see over a lowercase i and a lowercase j is called a tittle – an interesting name that seems like a portmanteau (combination) of “tiny” and “little,” and refers to a small point or stroke in writing and printing. Generally, a diacritic dot such as a tittle is also referred to as a glyph . However, in regards to i and j, the removal of the mark is still likely to be read as I or J; as such, these are not examples of a glyph.\nDerived from the Latin word titulus, meaning “inscription, heading,” the tittle initially appeared in Latin manuscripts beginning in the 11th century as a way of individualizing the neighboring letters i and j in the thicket of handwriting. With the introduction of the Roman-style typeface in the late 1400′s, the original large mark was reduced to the small dot we use today.\nMany alphabets use a tittle specifically in the case of the letter i. For example, the absence or presence of a tittle over the i in the modern Turkish alphabet, also Latin-based, helps to differentiate two unique letters that represent distinct phonemes .\nThe phrase “To a T” is believed to be derived from the word tittle and the following passage from Edward Hall’s Chronicles circa 1548: “I then… began to dispute with my selfe, little considerynge that thus my earnest was turned euen to a tittyl not so good as, estamen.”\nNow that you’ve satisfied your desire to know the source of that little dot, consider this: Why does the letter Q almost never appear without a U right next to it? Find your answer, here .\nWhat other mysteries of the alphabet would like us to explore? Let us know.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name for the dot on the lower case letters I and J?\nAnswer:\n",

The station was opened in 1849 by the Leeds & Thirsk Railway, later part of the Leeds Northern Railway to Northallerton.\n\nLocation and areas served\n\nThe station is halfway between Headingley centre and Kirkstall, just down the road from the Headingley Stadium's rugby and cricket grounds. It is over half a mile from the centre of Headingley itself, but close to local bus routes on Kirkstall Hill, Kirkstall Road and Kirkstall Lane. It is also close to local shops and services in Kirkstall, including Kirkstall Leisure Centre.  The station also serves the West Park and Queenswood Drive areas, which it is linked to by a pedestrian footpath through the Headingley Station allotments.  The predominantly student occupied houses between Kirkstall Lane and St. Ann's Drive are also within a short walk.  It is the closest railway station to Leeds Beckett University's Beckett Park campus.\n\nServices\n\nMonday to Saturday daytimes, is generally a half-hourly service southbound to Leeds and a half-hourly service northbound to Knaresborough with one train per hour onwards to York.

    "input": "Passage:\nAnn Dunham - Academic, Anthropologist - Biography.com\nAnn Dunham - Academic, Anthropologist - Biography.com\nFamous People Born in Fort Leavenworth\nSynopsis\nAnn Dunham (born November 29, 1942) met Kenyan national Barack Obama, Sr. while at the University of Hawaii and married him after she became pregnant. They later divorced and she cared for her son while juggling a full college course load. She went on to perform doctoral fieldwork in Indonesia, and became an activist and social scientist. She died of cancer on November 7, 1995 at the age of 52.\nEarly Life\nActivist and social scientist Stanley Ann Dunham was born on November 29, 1942, in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to parents Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. Madelyn was the first female vice president of a local bank, and Stanley was an army veteran and furniture salesman.\nStanley Ann Dunham was named after her father who had always wanted a son. In spite of being teased about her name, Stanley Ann was a resilient and liberal minded daughter. During her formative years, she and her parents relocated between Kansas, California, Texas, and Washington. After high school, Stanley Dunham moved the family to Honolulu despite his daughter's early acceptance to the University of Chicago. After enrolling in the University of Hawaii, Stanley Ann began going simply by \"Ann.\"\nMarriage and Barack's Birth\nIt was in a college language class that Ann Dunham met Barack H. Obama, Sr. He was a Kenyan national recruited overseas on a college scholarship, and was reputed to be an opinionated, magnetic debater. He and Dunham soon began dating. Several months later, Dunham became pregnant. She and Barack were married in a private ceremony on February 2, 1961. On August 4, 1961, Ann gave birth to a boy and named him Barack Obama, Jr. after his father.\nAfter one semester at the University of Hawaii, Ann Dunham withdrew from college to help care for her new family. Soon after, Barack Sr. accepted a scholarship to pursue a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University. Acknowledging her husband's life quest of revitalizing Kenya's economy, Dunham decided to remain behind in Hawaii. In 1964 Ann filed for divorce, a decision which Barack Sr. did not contest.\nApproximately one year later, Dunham returned to the University of Hawaii. With help from her parents and government food stamps, she was able to juggle a full schedule of classes while caring for her son. Despite life as a struggling young mother, Ann Dunham earned her undergraduate degree in four years. During her tenure at the University of Hawaii, Dunham became romantically involved with fellow student Lolo Soetoro.\nMove to Indonesia\nPolite, even-tempered Soetoro was an international master's student from Indonesia. In 1967 he proposed to Dunham. Once married, Ann changed her surname to Soetoro and the new family relocated to Indonesia near the city of Jakarta. In 1970, Ann gave birth to daughter Maya.\nAnn Soetoro was often grieved by the quality of life for local Indonesians. Those who were close to her say she was compassionate almost to a fault, and would give money to countless ailing beggars. As Ann became more interested in Indonesian culture, her husband Lolo began working for a Western oil company.\nBored by the domestic, traditional course her marriage had taken, Ann intensified her focus on formal education. She began teaching English in the American Embassy. In the mornings she would give Barack Jr. his English lessons, and in the evenings she would give him books on civil rights and play him Mahalia Jackson's gospel songs.\nReturn to Hawaii\nWhen her son was 10 years old, Ann sent him back to Hawaii to attend prep school and reside with his grandparents. One year later, Ann and her daughter also returned to Hawaii. Here she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Hawaii to study cultural anthropology of Indonesian peoples. In 1980 she would file for divorce against her husband Lolo.\nAfter several years of schooling, Ann Soetoro returned to Indonesia for doctoral level fieldwork. Wishing to remain with his grandparents, 14-year-old Barack Obama Jr. declined to join his mother. Once back in Indonesia, Soetoro began working for the Ford Foundation studying women's employment concerns. From 1988 to 1992 Soetoro helped install a microfinance program in Indonesia where small business owners could gain small loans. Many credit Soetoro's research with informing fiscal lending policies, making Indonesia a world leader in microfinance loans.\nEarly Death\nThrough the years, Ann and her daughter would move around the world to Pakistan, New York, and back to Hawaii. In 1992 Ann Soetoro finally finished her doctoral dissertation: a 1,000-page analysis of peasant blacksmithing. In 1994 during a dinner party in Jakarta, Soetoro complained of stomach pains. Months later she was diagnosed with ovarian and uterine cancer. She died on November 7, 1995 at the age of 52.\nRelated Videos\nFact Check\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

    "input": "Passage:\nChanterelle\nCantharellus cibarius, commonly known as the chanterelle, or girolle, is a fungus. It is probably the best known species of the genus Cantharellus, if not the entire family of Cantharellaceae. It is orange or yellow, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, it has gill-like ridges that run almost all the way down its stipe, which tapers down seamlessly from the cap. It emits a fruity aroma, reminiscent of apricots and a mildly peppery taste (hence its German name, Pfifferling) and is considered an excellent edible mushroom.\n\nDistribution\n\nChanterelles are common in northern parts of Europe, North America,\nCentral America, including Mexico, in Asia, including Turkey and the Himalayas (including Kashmir, Nepal, and Bhutan), and in Africa including Zambia, Congo and Uganda. Chanterelles tend to grow in clusters in mossy coniferous forests, but are also often found in mountainous birch forests and among grasses and low-growing herbs. In central Europe, including Ukraine, the golden chanterelle is often found in beech forests among similar species and forms. In the UK, they may be found from July through to December.\n\nAt one time, all yellow or golden chanterelles in western North America had been classified as C. cibarius.  Using DNA analysis, they have since been shown to be a group of related species.  In 1997, the Pacific golden chanterelle (C. formosus) and C. cibarius var. roseocanus were identified, followed by C. cascadensis in 2003 and C. californicus in 2008.  C. cibarius var. roseocanus occurs in the Pacific Northwest in Sitka spruce forests, as well as Eastern Canada in association with Pinus banksiana.\n\nBiochemistry\n\nChanterelles are relatively high in vitamin C (0.4 mg/g fresh weight), very high in potassium (about 0.5%, fresh weight), and are among the richest sources of vitamin D known, with ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) as high as 212 IU/100 grams fresh weight. Scientific research has suggested that the golden chanterelle may have potent insecticidal properties that are harmless to humans and yet protect the mushroom body against insects and other potentially harmful organisms.\n\nCulinary use\n\nThough records of chanterelles being eaten date back to the 16th century, they first gained widespread recognition as a culinary delicacy with the spreading influence of French cuisine in the 18th century, where they began appearing in palace kitchens. For many years, they remained notable for being served at the tables of nobility. Nowadays, the usage of chanterelles in the kitchen is common throughout Europe and North America. In 1836, the Swedish mycologist Elias Fries considered the chanterelle \"as one of the most important and best edible mushrooms.\"\n\nChanterelles as a group are generally described as being rich in flavor, with a distinctive taste and aroma difficult to characterize. Some species have a fruity odor, others a more woody, earthy fragrance, and still others can even be considered spicy. The golden chanterelle is perhaps the most sought-after and flavorful chanterelle, and many chefs consider it on the same short list of gourmet fungi as truffles and morels. It therefore tends to command a high price in both restaurants and specialty stores.\n\nThere are many ways to cook chanterelles. Most of the flavorful compounds in chanterelles are fat-soluble, making them good mushrooms to sauté in butter, oil or cream. They also contain smaller amounts of water- and alcohol-soluble flavorings, which lend the mushrooms well to recipes involving wine or other cooking alcohols. Many popular methods of cooking chanterelles include them in sautés, soufflés, cream sauces, and soups. They are not typically eaten raw, as their rich and complex flavor is best released when cooked.\n\nChanterelles are also well-suited for drying, and tend to maintain their aroma and consistency quite well. Some chefs profess that reconstituted chanterelles are actually superior in flavor to fresh ones, though they lose in texture whatever they gain in flavor by becoming more chewy after being preserved by drying. Dried chanterelles can also be crushed into flour and used in seasoning in soups or sauces. Chanterelles are also suitable for freezing, though older frozen chanterelles can often develop a slightly bitter taste after thawing.\n\nIn the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, it is known as Sisi Shamu and is generally picked from the forests. During the season, it is cooked with cheese and chillies or cooked with meat.\n\nSimilar species\n\nThe false chanterelle (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) has a similar appearance and can be confused with the chanterelle. Distinguishing factors are color (the true chanterelle is uniform egg-yellow, while the false one is more orange in hue and graded, with darker center) and attachment of gills to the stem (the true chanterelle has ridges or wrinkles, which can be quite deep, but not true gills). Though once thought to be hazardous, it is now known that the false chanterelle is edible but not especially tasty, and ingesting it may result in mild gastrointestinal distress. The poisonous species in the genus Omphalotus (the jack-o'-lantern mushrooms) have been misidentified as chanterelles, but can usually be distinguished by their well-developed unforked gills. Species of Omphalotus are not closely related to chanterelles. Other species in the closely related genera Cantharellus and Craterellus may appear similar to the golden chanterelle.\n\nCantharellus pallens has sometimes been defined as a species in its own right, but it is normally considered to be just a variety (C. cibarius var. pallens).  Unlike \"true\" C. cibarius it yellows and then reddens when touched and has a weaker smell.  Eyssartier and Roux classify it as a separate species but say that 90% of the chanterelles sold in French markets are this, not C. cibarius.\n\nSimilarly Cantharellus alborufescens, which is very pale, reddens easily, and is found in mediterranean areas, is sometimes distinguished as a separate variety or a separate species.\nQuestion:\nChanterelle and Oyster are types of what?\nAnswer:\n",

The service station is situated between junctions 6 and 8 of the M61 motorway (there is no junction 7).\n\nHistory\n\nThe services were first built in 1971 under the original name of Anderton services; however, they were later renamed Rivington services, and Bolton West services. In 2011 they retook the name Rivington services after being acquired by Euro Garages from First.   It has changed hands a number of times having been owned by the Kenning Motor Group, Rank, Pavilion, Granada, and BP who leased it to First Motorway Services. In the summer of 2009, the service area was acquired by Blackburn-based Euro Garages. After years of criticism, which was dubbed as the worst service station in the country,  plans are on the way to demolish the existing buildings and replaced by a smaller main building, petrol station and other facilities and amenities.  These new facilities are currently being phased in and includes the forementioned retaking of the name Rivington Services. It is thought that the name was changed in order to remove the connection with the former First-owned services. \n\nMedia\n\nWhen known as Bolton West the services were used in the filming of The Services, a pilot episode for comedian Peter Kay series That Peter Kay Thing, a spoof documentary of a day in the life of motorway service area staff.\nQuestion:\nJust north of Bolton, on which English motorway will you find Rivington Services?\nAnswer:\n",

To start anew, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia with Daniel Peggotty and Little Em'ly, where Micawber becomes manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate.\n\nIn Hablot Knight Browne's illustrations for the first edition, Micawber is shown wearing knee-breeches, a top hat, and a monocle.\n\nPopular culture\n\nMicawber is known for asserting his faith that \"something will turn up\".  His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation.  This has formed the basis for the Micawber Principle, based upon his observation:\n\n\"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery.\" - (Chapter 12)\n\n[The amounts quoted are equivalent to £20, £19 97½p and £20 2½p, in the United Kingdom's present, decimal, currency.]\n\nThe character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger.  Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial.\n\nKeith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) \"Micawber\". Richards is known to be a fan of Dickens. Of the unusual moniker attached to the instrument, Richards said, \"There's no reason for my guitar being called Micawber, apart from the fact that it's such an unlikely name. There's no one around me called Micawber, so when I scream for Micawber everyone knows what I'm talking about.\"\n\nIn addition, the character formed the basis of Micawber, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role.\n\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562 (2007), Justice Souter criticized the court below for an approach to pleading that \"would dispense with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's optimism would be enough.\" (quotations and citations omitted).\n\nEntry into general English\n\nThe character of Wilkins Micawber has given rise to the English noun \"Micawber\" and the adjectives \"Micawberish\" and \"Micawberesque\". The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a Micawber as \"one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune\".  Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte's legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as \"pure Micawberism\". \n\nQuotations\n\nBesides the Micawber Principle, Micawber is notable for a number of memorable quotations:\n* I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if -if, in short, anything turns up. - (Chapter 1)\n* Every happiness and prosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I had not occupied another man's place altogether in vain. - (Chapter 12)\n* You HEEP of infamy! - (Chapter 52)\n* I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon, combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre.  I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, \"FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY.\" Remaining always, &c, &c, Wilkins Micawber.\n* Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!\n\nFilm and television portrayals\n\nQuotations from the 1935 film\n\n*Boy, as I have frequently had occasion to observe: \"When the stomach is empty, the spirits are low!\"\n* Remember my motto \"Nil Desperandum! -Never despair!\"\n\nQuotation from the BBC TV/Masterpiece Theatre production\n\n* (featuring Bob Hoskins as Micawber) \"I could not depart this metropolis without paying a valedictory visit to my dear friend Copperfield, in whose debt I shall forever remain (I speak metaphorically of course!)\"\n\nSources\n\n* Bloom, Harold.

When the new Queen was crowned a couple of months later, he was among the select few invited to celebrate the day in No 2 Carlton Gardens, a discreet building overlooking the Mall from where the men who ran Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service were watching the royal procession. Little did they know that during his time as a prisoner he had become a Communist and decided to work for the KGB.\nGeorge Blake worked as a double agent for the Soviet Union until he was discovered in 1961 and sentenced to 42 years in prison. He escaped from Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1966 and fled to the USSR.\nAll traitors are complicated, but no one more so than Blake. In The Righteous Traitor, director George Carey speaks to Blake’s close acquaintances, historians and other former spies to chronicle his curious history. A close friend of his, Louis Wesserling, describes Blake: “He was a gambler…He spied to fill a void. It gave him a sense of enormous importance”. According to Tim Weiner, the famous historian of the CIA, “the revelation of Blake’s treachery did more damage to relations between Britain and America than all the Cambridge Five put together.”\nDirected by George Carey\nYear: 2015\nTopics:\nQuestion:\nWhich spy was sentenced to 42 years in prison in 1961, but escaped from Wormwood Scrubs in 1966?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nBill Pullman\nWilliam James \"Bill\" Pullman (born December 17, 1953) is an American actor.\n\nHe made his film debut in the 1986 film Ruthless People, and has since gone on to star in other films, such as Spaceballs (1987), While You Were Sleeping (1995), Casper (1995), Independence Day (1996) and Lost Highway (1997). He has also appeared regularly on television, usually in films and miniseries, though he also had a starring role in the one-season show 1600 Penn.\n\nEarly life\n\nPullman was born in Hornell, New York, the son of James Pullman, a physician, and his wife Johanna (née Blaas), a nurse. His father is of English ancestry, and his mother is of Dutch ancestry. After graduating from Hornell High School in 1971, he attended the State University of New York at Delhi (SUNY Delhi)  and the State University of New York at Oneonta in the 1970s. He eventually received his Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Pullman taught theater at SUNY Delhi and Montana State University's School of Film and Photography, where he was convinced by his students to attempt film.\n\nCareer\n\nDuring the 1980s, he primarily worked with theater companies around New York and Los Angeles. His first prominent film role was in Ruthless People (which starred Danny DeVito and Bette Midler). Other notable films included the lead in Spaceballs (1987),  The Serpent and the Rainbow (with Zakes Mokae), and While You Were Sleeping (1995). In 1996, he played the president of the United States in the sci-fi disaster film Independence Day. A year later he had a major role in Lost Highway (1997) and voiced Korso in the animated post-apocalyptic film Titan A.E..  His more recent films have included The Grudge and Scary Movie 4.\n\nFrom February 2001 until February 2002, Pullman starred with Mercedes Ruehl, in Edward Albee's play The Goat, or Who is Sylvia? on Broadway. The play won several awards: 2002 Tony Award for Best Play; 2002 Drama Desk Award Outstanding New Play; 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Pullman was nominated for the 2002 Drama Desk Award Outstanding Actor in a Play. He starred as Dr. Richard Massey in the miniseries Revelations. Pullman starred in Edward Albee's Peter and Jerry, at Off-Broadway's Second Stage Theatre in New York. For his performance, Pullman received a second Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Actor in a Play in 2008.\n\nIn addition to acting, Pullman is a creative writer. His first play, Expedition 6, is about the International Space Station mission Expedition 6 that was in orbit at the time that the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed on reentry, grounding the U.S. space shuttle program, which was to provide the vehicle for the crew's return to earth. The play opened at San Francisco's Magic Theater in September 2007. \n\nHe also appeared in the Broadway production of David Mamet's Oleanna, co-starring Julia Stiles.  The production opened at the John Golden Theatre October 11, 2009, and closed on December 6, 2009, playing 65 performances. \n\nHe is also a Jury Member for the digital studio Filmaka, a platform for undiscovered filmmakers to show their work to industry professionals.\n\nPullman played Oswald Danes, a pedophile and child killer, in Torchwood: Miracle Day, the fourth series of the BBC/Starz Entertainment television show Torchwood, which began airing in July 2011. For his performance as Danes, Pullman has received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor In Television. \n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, Pullman portrayed the President of the United States in the television comedy series 1600 Penn.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPullman is married to Tamara Hurwitz and they have three children.  Hurwitz is of part Norwegian descent.   He co-owns a cattle ranch with his brother in Montana, near the town of Whitehall, where he lives part-time.  He also serves on the Board of Trustees at Alfred University and was awarded an honorary doctorate on May 14, 2011. \n\nFilmography\nQuestion:\nWhich film starring Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum was the world's highest grossing film of 1996?\nAnswer:\n",

He said he first came up with the idea when he was thinking how to make a boat go faster by reducing the amount of friction caused when it travels through the water.\nHe first tested the 'hover' theory using a cat food tin inside a coffee tin, with an industrial air blower and a pair of kitchen scales.\nIn 1955 he convinced the Ministry of Supply to back him but he was not able to commercially develop the product immediately as his idea had been placed on the government's secret list because of its potential benefits to the military.\nIn 1959 Cockerell managed to get his idea removed from the secret list and formed the Hovercraft Development Company Ltd.\nHe obtained funding from the National Research Development Council of �150,000 to develop the project.\nA contract to build the first Hovercraft was awarded to Saunders Roe, the flying boat firm at Cowes, at the beginning of this year.\nThe SRN-1, an experimental model, is 29 feet long and 24 feet wide and weighs 6,600lb.\nFollowing today's launch of the SRN-1 hovercraft in the Solent, Saunders Roe announced it is now planning a prototype up to ten times as big and weighing 40 tons.\nThe hovercraft, which has controls very similar to those in a helicopter, can reach speeds of up to 25-knots and it is hoped that at some stage in the future it will be able to cross the English Channel in as little as 20 minutes.\nQuestion:\nChristopher Cockerill invented what in 1955?\nAnswer:\n",

Stalag 17, exclusively populated by American sergeants, is overseen by sadistic commandant Oberst Von Schernbach (Otto Preminger) and the deceptively avuncular sergeant Schultz (Sig Ruman). The inmates spend their waking hours circumventing the boredom of prison life; at night, they attempt to arrange escapes. When two of the escapees, Johnson and Manfredi, are shot down like dogs by the Nazi guards, Stalag 17's resident wiseguy Sefton (William Holden) callously collects the bets he'd placed concerning the fugitives' success. No doubt about it: there's a security leak in the barracks, and everybody suspects the enterprising Sefton -- who manages to obtain all the creature comforts he wants -- of being a Nazi infiltrator. Things get particularly dicey when Lt. Dunbar (Don Taylor), temporarily billetted in Stalag 17 before being transferred to an officer's camp, tells his new bunkmates that he was responsible for the destruction of a German ammunition train. Sure enough, this information is leaked to the Commandant, and Dunbar is subjected to a brutal interrogation. Certain by now that Sefton is the \"mole\", the other inmates beat him to a pulp. But Sefton soon learns who the real spy is, and reveals that information on the night of Dunbar's planned escape. Despite the seriousness of the situation, Stalag 17 is as much comedy as wartime melodrama, with most of the laughs provided by Robert Strauss as the Betty Grable-obsessed \"Animal\" and Harvey Lembeck as Stosh's best buddy Harry. Other standouts in the all-male cast include Richard Erdman as prisoner spokesman Hoffy, Neville Brand as the scruffy Duke, Peter Graves as blonde-haired, blue-eyed \"all American boy\" Price, Gil Stratton as Sefton's sidekick Cookie (who also narrates the film) and Robinson Stone as the catatonic, shell-shocked Joey. Writer/producer/director Billy Wilder and coscenarist Edmund Blum remained faithful to the plot and mood the Donald Bevan/Edmund Trzcinski stage play Stalag 17, while changing virtually every line of dialogue-all to the better, as it turned out (Trzcinski, who like Bevan based the play on his own experiences as a POW, appears in the film as the ingenuous prisoner who \"really believes\" his wife's story about the baby abandoned on her doorstep). William Holden won an Academy Award for his hard-bitten portrayal of Sefton, which despite a hokey \"I'm really a swell guy after all\" gesture near the end of the film still retains its bite today. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\nRating:\nQuestion:\nWhich screen tough-guy won a Best Actor Oscar for the 1953 film 'Stalag 17'?\nAnswer:\n",

It was open in 1998 and located in the Fantasy World area of the park.\nWhile riders queue they are shown numerous videos showing The Lord of Darkness (played by Renny Krupinski). He apparently lives in the underground tunnel and tells you that the ride is perfectly safe.\nOne of the videos shows his alter ego, the Lord of Light, who is shown warning riders that they might die. Another video, shown at the cafe is a mock news flash detailing how a ride car has gone missing, this fuels the rumours that cars have fallen into the pit and have never been recovered. The Lord of Darkness leaves the last video with mocking, booming laughter, just as riders board the ride. These are all designed to build up fear and tension before the drop.\nThe roller coaster has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87.9° degrees into a dark tunnel followed by a 180° banked turn back to the station. The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight. The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop. As each car reaches the drop it is held by a drop chain (reverse of a lift chain) for a few seconds before the clutch is released allowing the riders to drop into a pitch black tunnel, whilst a pre-recorded and disembodied voice says 'don't look down' just before release. This can only be heard by the riders at the top of the drop track.  However, this was removed in 2004 after the park lost a court case over local residents complaining about the noise of the park.\nThe footage is taken from the YourDay DVD.  Visitors can wear special wristbands which trigger footage of you on the main rides and this customised footage is shown on the DVD.\nThe rides the DVD features include Congo River Rapids, Air and Nemesis.\nCheck out the how scary the vertical drop is!\nCategory\nQuestion:\nThe roller coaster ride called Rita is located at which English theme park?\nAnswer:\n",

The building was completely restored in order to house the Bargello National Museum, opened in 1865.\nCollections\nThe earlier museum was dedicated to Medieval applied arts: bronzes, majolicas, statues, coins, seals and medals. Donatello's year (1887-88) was the occasion to open the Hall of Renaissance Sculpture (today called \"of Donatello\") and between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the collection was further enlarged thanks to private donations and legacies (Carrand, Ressmann, Franchetti), with new ivories, enamels, arms and armours.\nToday, on the ground floor of the museum, the Hall of the 16th century Sculpture displays important works by Michelangelo, Benvenuto Cellini, Jacopo Sansovino and Giambologna.\nOn the first floor, a balcony (\"Verone\"), adorned with bronze animals by Giambologna, leads to the vast Audience Hall, which houses many masterpieces by Donatello, his assistants and Luca Della Robbia, along with the famous bronze reliefs cast by Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi in competition for the second doors of the Florentine Baptistery.

The gospel of John chapter 21. You know, the Bible says that Jesus spent 40 days after his resurrection from the dead on this earth. Most of that time he spent with his disciples before he went back to heaven. There were 40 days between the resurrection of Christ and the ascension of Christ. Then after the ascension of Christ there were ten more days to Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was sent by God to baptize the church into the body of Jesus. What do you imagine happened to the disciples during that 40 days of time after Jesus rose from the dead? Well, the Bible talks about five different appearances of Christ to His disciples. The Bible says that one time Jesus appeared to 500 of his disciples on one occasion, at one time. That 500 of them saw him at one time. But here in John 21, it's one of the most moving accounts of one of Jesus' post resurrection appearances.\nI would have to sum it up by saying during those 40 days following Jesus' resurrection, that Jesus, first of all, convinced his disciples he was alive. Secondly, Jesus comforted his disciples about his resurrection. He comforted them, that they had a future. Thirdly, Jesus commissioned his disciples to go out and preach the gospel to the entire world. So I would say that this passage tonight has to do with Jesus comforting, convincing, and commissioning his disciples, particularly Simon Peter. So here in the 21st chapter Jesus had victoriously and gloriously risen from the dead. Now, there was a short period of time between his resurrection and his appearance to the disciples in Galilee. Jesus had instructed them to go and wait for Him in Galilee and he said, ''Tell Peter, and the disciples that I will meet them in Galilee.'' He wanted especially Peter to know that he ...\nThere are 18882 characters in the full content.

    "input": "Passage:\nAndrea Gail\nF/V Andrea Gail was a commercial fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands during the \"Perfect Storm\" of 1991. The vessel and her six-man crew had been fishing the North Atlantic Ocean out of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Her last reported position was 180 mi northeast of Sable Island on October 28, 1991. The story of Andrea Gail and her crew was the basis of the 1997 book The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger, and a 2000 film adaptation of the same name.\n\nF/V Andrea Gail\n\nAndrea Gail was a 72 ft commercial fishing vessel constructed in Panama City, Florida in 1978, and owned by Robert Brown. Her home port was Marblehead, Massachusetts. She also sailed from Gloucester, Massachusetts, where she would offload her catch and reload food, fuel, and stores for her next run. She was originally named Miss Penny.\n\nLost at sea\n\nFinal voyage\n\nAndrea Gail began her final voyage departing from Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1991, bound for the Grand Banks of Newfoundland off the coast of eastern Canada. After poor fishing, Captain Frank W. \"Billy\" Tyne Jr. headed east to the Flemish Cap where he believed they would have better luck. Despite weather reports warning of dangerous conditions, Tyne set course for home on October 26–27. It is known that the ship's ice machine was malfunctioning and unable to maintain the catch for much longer. \n\nDisappearance\n\nThe last reported transmission from Andrea Gail was at about 6:00 p.m. on October 28, 1991. Captain Tyne radioed Linda Greenlaw, Captain of the Hannah Boden, owned by the same company, and gave his coordinates as , or about 162 mi east of Sable Island. He also gave a weather report indicating 30 ft seas and wind gusts up to 80 knots (150 km/h). Tyne's final recorded words were \"She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong.\" Junger reported that the storm created waves in excess of 100 ft in height, but ocean buoy monitors recorded a peak wave height of 39 ft, and so waves of 100 ft were deemed \"unlikely\" by Science Daily.  However, data from a series of weather buoys in the general vicinity of the vessel's last known location recorded peak wave action exceeding 60 ft in height from October 28 through 30, 1991.\n\nSearch\n\nOn October 30, 1991, the vessel was reported overdue. An extensive air and sea search was launched by the 106th Rescue Wing from the New York Air National Guard, United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard forces. The search would eventually cover over 186000 sqnmi.\n\nOn November 6, 1991, Andrea Gail's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was discovered washed up on the shore of Sable Island. The EPIRB was designed to automatically send out a distress signal upon contact with sea water, but the Canadian Coast Guard personnel who found the beacon \"did not conclusively verify whether the control switch was in the on or off position\".  Authorities called off the search for the missing vessel on November 9, 1991, due to the low probability of crew survival.\n\nFuel drums, a fuel tank, the EPIRB, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam were the only wreckage ever found. The ship was presumed lost at sea somewhere along the continental shelf near Sable Island.\n\nCrew\n\nAll six of the crew were lost at sea.\n\n* Frank William \"Billy\" Tyne Jr. (Captain), aged 37 Gloucester, Massachusetts\n* Michael \"Bugsy\" Moran, aged 36 Bradenton Beach, Florida\n* Dale R. \"Murph\" Murphy, aged 30 Bradenton Beach, Florida\n* Alfred Pierre, aged 32 New York City\n* Robert F. \"Bobby\" Shatford, aged 30 Gloucester, Massachusetts\n* David \"Sully\" Sullivan, aged 28 New York City\n\nIn the media\n\n*The story of Andrea Gail and her crew inspired Sebastian Junger's 1997 book, The Perfect Storm, and a 2000 film of the same name, distributed by Warner Brothers.

    "input": "Passage:\nBonspiel\nA Bonspiel is a curling tournament, consisting of several games, often held on a weekend. Until the 20th century most bonspiels were held outdoors, on a frozen freshwater loch. Today almost all bonspiels are held indoors on specially prepared artificial ice. Though it is not mandatory, curling teams at bonspiels often wear themed costumes.\n\nBonspiels in North America\n\nCanada\n\nBonspiels originated in Scotland, but the most notable competitive curling tournament in the world nowadays is The Brier, the Canadian Men's Curling Championship. For Canadians, this tournament equals or nearly equals the importance of the Olympics and the World Curling Championship. The Canadian Women's Curling Championship tournament is called Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Several Cashspiels are played in Canada every year. The most important cashspiels are part of the World Curling Tour (WCT). Many local curling clubs and other organizations in Canada also host casual, social bonspiels.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States Curling Association (USA Curling) is the national governing body of the sport in the United States. Many bonspiels are listed on [http://www.usacurl.org/ the USA Curling website].  Most bonspiels in the United States are held indoors in dedicated curling facilities. Bonspiels are popular throughout the United States during curling season, typically October through April. Some special bonspiels are held in the summer as well as some that are hosted by clubs that play on arena ice as there are usually fewer scheduling conflicts with other sports at the area such as hockey and figure skating.\n\nBonspiels in Europe\n\nScotland\n\nIn Scotland, outdoor bonspiels are now very rare; most lochs that formerly hosted bonspiels, such as Loch Earn, rarely freeze over anymore. The word spiel is sometimes used to refer to an informal curling game, as in parish spiel. The most important Cashspiels in Scotland are part of the Curling Champions Tour (CCT), previously known as the World Curling Tour Europe (WCT-E).\n\nOther European countries\n\nDozens of bonspiels are held in European countries every year. Switzerland hosts multiple Curling Champions Tour events.\n\nBonspiels elsewhere\n\nNew Zealand\n\nCurling bonspiels are held when ice conditions permit in the Maniototo, part of Central Otago in the South Island. The region is one of the few in New Zealand to have conditions suitable for outdoor curling, and is also a fitting site for the sport given that Otago's original European settlers were mainly from Scotland. Several artificial and natural lakes around the towns of Oturehua, Naseby and Patearoa provide good conditions, on average every second or third year.\n\nThe national bonspiel has been held when conditions permit since 1879, with Oturehua's Idaburn Dam the venue since 1932.  The most recent national bonspiel, the 65th, was held on 9–10 July 2012.  Owing to the difficulty of getting teams to the relatively inaccessible venue, it is rare for teams to travel from outside the southern South Island to the bonspiel.\n\nIndoor curling rinks exist in Otago's main centre, Dunedin (at the Dunedin Ice Stadium), and in the towns of Naseby, Otago and Gore, Southland, and also further north in the country's largest city, Auckland. Open air ice rinks exist in Naseby and Alexandra. \n\nList of Notable Bonspiels\n\n* The largest outdoor bonspiel in the world, the \"[http://www.ironmancurling.com Ironman Outdoor Curling Bonspiel]\" held on the Assiniboine River in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, has been held at The Forks Historic Port every February since 2002. In 2015 there were 72 teams competing.\n* One of the longest-running outdoor bonspiels in the world, the Bonspiel on the Lake in Invermere, British Columbia, Canada, has been held on Lake Windermere every January since 1982.  Each year 64 teams compete.\n* The Bonspiel or the Grand Match, between the north and the south of Scotland, is held on a frozen loch (most recently the Lake of Menteith, Stirling) when the winter is cold enough. It was last held in 1979.\n* The Crush Bonspiel in Placer Valley, California, is notorious for its unique combination of curling tournament play and wine festival.  This tournament originated in Vacaville in 2006 but was moved to Roseville  in 2012 because of its rising popularity in surrounding areas.\n* The Brier (Men's Senior Championship of the Canadian Curling Association) is regarded by most curlers as the world's premier curling championship\n* The Tournament of Hearts (Canadian Ladies Curling Association Championship)\n* The Men's World Curling Championship (Scotch Cup/Silver Broom) WCF WCC\n* The Women's World Curling Championship WCC\n* The World Junior Curling Championship (WJCC) WCF\n* The Winter Olympics\n\nOrigin of the word \"Bonspiel\"\n\nThe origin of the word is primarily Gaelic.\n\nSince curling is believed to have originated in Scotland, it is likely that \"bonspiel\" is a modern adaptation of the Scottish Gaelic words \"bonn\" (coin)  and \"spéil\" (skate)  meaning \"coin skate\" or \"cornerstone skate\" (archaic definition). \n\n\"Spiel\" may also have been a Germanic borrowing, meaning \"game\". In that case, the word may have meant \"cornerstone game\".\nQuestion:\nIf you had two eight enders in one bonspiel what are you playing\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nPigeon Post\nPigeon Post is an English children's adventure novel by Arthur Ransome, published by Jonathan Cape in 1936. It was the sixth of twelve books Ransome completed in the Swallows and Amazons series (1930 to 1947). He won the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising it as the year's best children's book by a British subject.\n\nThis book is one of the few Swallows and Amazons books that does not feature sailing. All the action takes place on and under the fells surrounding the Lake, as the characters attempt to discover precious metals in the Lake District hills. \n \n \n\nPlot summary\n\nThe Swallows, Amazons and Ds are camping in the Blackett family's garden at Beckfoot. The Swallow is not available for sailing. James Turner (Captain Flint) has sent word that he is returning from an expedition to South America prospecting for gold, and has sent \"Timothy\" ahead. As he can be let loose in the study, they deduce that Timothy is an armadillo and make a box for him, but he does not arrive.  Slater Bob, an old slate miner, tells them a story about a lost gold vein in the fells. As Captain Flint has been unsuccessful in his prospecting trip, plans are made to prospect for gold on High Topps instead.\n\nThe children prove they can stay in touch with Beckfoot using the homing pigeons that give the book its name, and earn permission to move camp to Tyson's Farm, up near the fells, to be closer to the prospecting grounds. They are disappointed in that Mrs Tyson does not permit them to cook over a campfire, owing to drought conditions and her fear of fires. Titty eventually finds a spring by dowsing and they move closer to the Topps. They send daily messages home by pigeon.\n\nWhile exploring the ground, they notice a rival prospector whom they call 'Squashy Hat'. After days of prospecting, they find a seam of gold-coloured mineral in an old mining excavation, and crush enough of it to produce a golden ingot in a charcoal furnace. Unfortunately it disappears when the crucible breaks and Dick Callum has only a small amount to test.  Meanwhile Squashy Hat is consulting the old slate miner, walking through beneath the fell via an old mine working.  Seeing him, the younger four children follow him, with very nearly fatal results.  Christina Hardyment writes that venturing into the Old Level was probably the most idiotic thing that any of Ransome's characters ever did.\n\nCaptain Flint returns home and finds Dick doing chemical tests on the putative gold in his study. Dick has read that gold dissolves in aqua regia, but Captain Flint explains \"Aqua regia will dissolve almost anything. The point about gold is it won't dissolve in anything else…\" He shows Dick by other tests that they have found copper pyrites, a rich copper ore.\n\nA pigeon arrives with an urgent message from Titty, FIRE HELP QUICK. Captain Flint rings Colonel Jolys who musters his volunteer fire fighters, and they all rush to help save the Topps. After the fire on the fells is extinguished, Squashy Hat is revealed to be Captain Flint's friend Timothy, who has been too shy to introduce himself to the children. Captain Flint is pleased to find copper, as he had talked with Timothy above Pernambuco in South America about new ways of prospecting for copper on the fells. Indeed, prospecting for copper, not gold, had been the purpose of the expedition to South America in the first place.\n\nThe mining project recurs in the later book The Picts and the Martyrs.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe British Library Association presented Ransome with the inaugural Carnegie Medal at its annual conference in June 1936. Notices in The New York Times recognised that as comparable to the American Newbery Medal. The following month Lippincott of Philadelphia published the first U.S. edition, which Ellen Lewis Buell reviewed for the newspaper in August. She noted the children's \"vivid collective imagination which turned play into serious business\" and observed, \"It is the portrayal of this spirit which makes play a matter of desperate yet enjoyable earnestness which gives their distinctive stamp to Mr. Ransome's books. ... Because he understands the whole-heartedness of youth he can invest a momentary experiment, such as young Roger's Indian scout work, with real suspense.\"\n\"The New Books for Boys and Girls\", Ellen Buell Lewis, The New York Times, 22 August 1937, p. BR10. Ransome made use of the mining and prospecting knowledge and experience of his friend Oscar Gnosspelius, who appears in the book as 'Squashy Hat'.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the children's books 'Pigeon Post' and 'Coot Club'?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nMagnetic flux\nIn physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux (often denoted  or ) through a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field B passing through that surface. The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and electronics, that evaluates the change of voltage in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux.\n\nDescription\n\n \nThe magnetic interaction is described in terms of a vector field, where each point in space (and time) is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point (see Lorentz force). Since a vector field is quite difficult to visualize at first, in elementary physics one may instead visualize this field with field lines. The magnetic flux through some surface, in this simplified picture, is proportional to the number of field lines passing through that surface (in some contexts, the flux may be defined to be precisely the number of field lines passing through that surface; although technically misleading, this distinction is not important). Note that the magnetic flux is the net number of field lines passing through that surface; that is, the number passing through in one direction minus the number passing through in the other direction (see below for deciding in which direction the field lines carry a positive sign and in which they carry a negative sign).\nIn more advanced physics, the field line analogy is dropped and the magnetic flux is properly defined as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field passing through a surface. If the magnetic field is constant, the magnetic flux passing through a surface of vector area S is\n\n\\Phi_B \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{S} \n BS \\cos \\theta,\n\nwhere B is the magnitude of the magnetic field (the magnetic flux density) having the unit of Wb/m2 (tesla), S is the area of the surface, and θ is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to S. For a varying magnetic field, we first consider the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area element dS, where we may consider the field to be constant: \n\nd\\Phi_B = \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}.\n\nA generic surface, S, can then be broken into infinitesimal elements and the total magnetic flux through the surface is then the surface integral\n\n\\Phi_B = \\iint\\limits_S \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf S.\n\nFrom the definition of the magnetic vector potential A and the fundamental theorem of the curl the magnetic flux may also be defined as:\n\\Phi_B = \\oint\\limits_{\\partial S} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell},\nwhere the line integral is taken over the boundary of the surface S, which is denoted ∂S.\n\nMagnetic flux through a closed surface\n\nGauss's law for magnetism, which is one of the four Maxwell's equations, states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is equal to zero. (A \"closed surface\" is a surface that completely encloses a volume(s) with no holes.) This law is a consequence of the empirical observation that magnetic monopoles have never been found.\n\nIn other words, Gauss's law for magnetism is the statement:\n\nfor any closed surface S.\n\nMagnetic flux through an open surface\n\nWhile the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero, the magnetic flux through an open surface need not be zero and is an important quantity in electromagnetism. For example, a change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop of conductive wire will cause an electromotive force, and therefore an electric current, in the loop.  The relationship is given by Faraday's law:\n\n\\mathcal{E} \\oint_{\\partial \\Sigma}\\left(  \\mathbf{E} +\\mathbf{ v \\times B}\\right) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell} \n -{d\\Phi_B \\over dt},\n\nwhere\n\\mathcal{E} is the electromotive force (EMF),\nΦB is the magnetic flux through the open surface Σ,\n∂Σ is the boundary of the open surface Σ; note that the surface, in general, may be in motion and deforming, and so is generally a function of time. The electromotive force is induced along this boundary.\ndℓ is an infinitesimal vector element of the contour ∂Σ,\nv is the velocity of the boundary ∂Σ,\nE is the electric field,\nB is the magnetic field.\n\nThe two equations for the EMF are, firstly, the work per unit charge done against the Lorentz force in moving a test charge around the (possibly moving) surface boundary ∂Σ and, secondly, as the change of magnetic flux through the open surface Σ. This equation is the principle behind an electrical generator.\n\nComparison with electric flux\n\nBy way of contrast, Gauss's law for electric fields, another of Maxwell's equations, is\n\nwhere\nE is the electric field,\nS is any closed surface,\nQ is the total electric charge inside the surface S,\nε0 is the electric constant (a universal constant, also called the \"permittivity of free space\").\n\nNote that the flux of E through a closed surface is not always zero; this indicates the presence of \"electric monopoles\", that is, free positive or negative charges.\nQuestion:\nNamed in honour of the Scottish physicist who presented the unified theory of electromagnetism, what is the CGS unit of magnetic flux?\nAnswer:\n",

While the film is clearly Robin William's vehicle, Kirby, playing 2nd Lt. Hauck, is the perfect comedic foil. Kirby plays the uptight Hauck, who can't wait to get his hands on the microphone, in way that brings many of the laughs and sets Robin Williams up for more. I continue to use his line \"and if you doooooo...\" when someone, e.g. my wife or children, do not seem to be listening to me intently enough. Kirby does this in a scene where he is giving instructions to his underlings, who are routinely ignoring him as they comment on things having nothing to do with his agenda. This is a great movie. Williams gives one of his best performances, and you already know how I feel about Bruno Kirby.

    "input": "Passage:\nSudanese teddy bear blasphemy case\nThe Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case concerns the 2007 arrest, trial, conviction, imprisonment and subsequent release of British schoolteacher Gillian Gibbons, who taught middle-class Muslim and Christian children at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan. She was convicted of insulting Islam by allowing her class of six-year-olds to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\".\n\nArrest\n\nGillian Gibbons was born in 1953 and gained a Bachelor of Education degree from the C.F. Mott College of Education in Prescot in 1975 (the college closed in 1992).  Teaching in a school in Sudan, she was arrested for allegedly insulting Islam by allowing her class of six-year-olds to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\".\n\nInitially it was thought that the complaint had originated from a parent of one of the children at the school.  However, it was later revealed that an office assistant employed at the school, Sara Khawad, had filed the complaint and was the key witness for the prosecution. Khawad was said to be angry with the school's head teacher. \"I was used by the secretary to get at the school\", Gibbons told The Guardian shortly after her release.\n\nSudan's legal system is strongly influenced by sharia, which prohibits depictions of Muhammad and other prophets. However, many Muslim organizations in other countries publicly condemned the Sudanese over their reactions,  as Gibbons did not set out to cause offence.  The chairman of the Unity School council, Ezikiel Kondo, indicated that he perceived ulterior motives in the affair, \"The thing may be very simple, but they just may make it bigger. It's a kind of blackmail.\"\n\nConviction and reaction\n\nOn 25 November 2007, Gibbons was arrested, interrogated and then put in a cell at a local police station. On 28 November, it was reported that she had been formally charged under Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Act, for \"insulting religion, inciting hatred, sexual harassment, racism, prostitution and showing contempt for religious beliefs\". This carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment, a fine, or 40 lashes. On 29 November 2007, Gibbons was found guilty of \"insulting religion;\" one of the three counts against her, and was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and deportation.  The Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella organization of British Muslim groups, including MPACUK  said the punishment was \"completely unjustified\"  and that it was \"appalled\",  and called on the Sudanese government to intervene. \n\nOn 30 November approximately 10,000 protesters took to the streets in Khartoum,  some of them waving swords and machetes, demanding Gibbons's execution after imams denounced her during Friday prayers. During the march, chants of \"Shame, shame on the UK\", \"No tolerance – execution\" and \"Kill her, kill her by firing squad\" were heard.  Witnesses reported that government employees were involved in inciting the protests.  Gibbons was then moved to a secret location because of fears for her safety.\n\nRelease\n\nIn an attempt to push for the release of Gibbons, two British Muslim peers (members of the House of Lords), Lord Ahmed (Labour) and Baroness Warsi (Conservative), visited Sudan with hopes of talking to the country's President Omar al-Bashir. \n\nWhile the two British politicians were meeting the President on 3 December it was announced that Gibbons was to be released from prison having been granted a Presidential pardon. After eight days in jail, she was released into the care of the British embassy in Khartoum and then returned to Liverpool, after issuing a written statement saying: \"I have a great respect for the Islamic religion and would not knowingly offend anyone.\"  \n\nAfterwards\n\nThe school was closed until January 2008 for the safety of pupils and staff as reprisals were feared.\nQuestion:\nIn what Sudan city was Gillian Gibbons imprisoned for the blasphemous naming of a teddy bear incident?\nAnswer:\n",

He was the first person                  who produced a list of elements found in nature.\nAntoine Laurent Lavoisier\n \nAntoine Laurent Lavoisier was the person who founded the major                  constituent of our planet and named it as 'Hydrogen' in the year                  1783 and acknowledged it was the major component of water. Five                  years earlier, he also discovered the most important element of                  our earth and named it as 'Oxygen' in the year 1778. In 1777,                  he established 'Sulfur' as an element rather than a mixture of                  various elements. Because of immense contribution in reforming                  the nomenclature system of chemical elements, he is still known                  as the 'father of modern chemistry.'\nAntoine Laurent Lavoisier was born in a wealthy family of Paris                  on August 26, 1743 and he was a student of College Mazarin from                  1754 to 1761 where he studied, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics                  and botany. At the age of 28, he married Marie-Anne Pierrette                  Paulze in the year 1771 when she was just 13 years old. Marie-Anne                  also developed interest in chemistry and helped her husband as                  a colleague by translating important English documents in French.                  She also wrote and published a biography of Antoine Laurent Lavoisier                  by the name Lavoisier's memoirs.\nAntoine Laurent Lavoisier not only discovered and named Oxygen                  he also demonstrated the process of rusting and the importance                  of oxygen for the life of animals and plants by establishing role                  of Oxygen in respiration. He was one of the first chemists who                  performed some completely quantitative chemical experiments to                  give birth to stoichiometry. He was the first to establish the                  law of conservation of mass. With the help of one of his truly                  quantitative chemical experiments, he established that animals                  use oxygen as a respiratory gas and the respiratory gas exchange                  is a process of combustion that produces heat and is similar to                  the process of burning of a candle.\nApart from his role as chemist, botanist and physicist, Antoine                  Laurent Lavoisier also achieved a law degree. However, he never                  practiced law in his entire life. Being a powerful member of Ferme                  Generale, he was one of the 28 tax collectors of France and during                  the French revolution he suffered the wrath of French revolutionaries.\nWhile Antoine Laurent Lavoisier was a liberal in the actual sense,                  he suffered opposition from Jean-Paul Marat who was a supporter                  of revolutionaries.\nAt the height of French Revolution, Jean-Paul Marat accused Lavoisier                  of treachery in selling watered-down tobacco and many other crimes.                  In the year 1794, during the period of 'Reign of Terror' Antoine                  Laurent Lavoisier helped some foreign born scientists and mathematicians                  including Joseph Louis Lagrange and it was considered as treason.\nThe judge, who was hearing the case of Antoine Laurent Lavoisier,                  rejected an appeal to forgive his life to support his incomplete                  experiments. The judge claimed, \"The Republic needs neither                  scientists nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.\" On May 8, 1794, when he was 50 years old, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier                  was guillotined in Paris.\nRumor Has It ï¿½\nAntoine Laurent Lavoisier tried to give hemorrhoids a place on                  the elemental periodic table (Hd) but the rest of the scientific                  community at that time either sat on their butts or said a few                  choice curse words about his outlandish claim.\nWritten by Kevin Lepton\nQuestion:\nWhich French chemist, regarded as the father of modern chemistry, was guillotined in 1794?\nAnswer:\n",

This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie's very first appearance in animation.   The short, and the three nephews, was the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.

In order to understand how these processes work, though, we have to talk about the structure and composition of the delicious, delicious globs of fat in milk that give rise to cheese.\nThe Globs\nTo a cheesemaker, the most important parts of the milk are the micelles.  What is a micelle, you say?  It’s a clump of molecules that hang around together in a liquid, and they are usually in a spherical form.\nImage from University of Calgary Department of Chemistry\nThey hang out in a sphere because these molecules, such as the fatty acids found in milk, contain both a polar and a non-polar portion.  Polar molecules, like water, do not like to mix with non-polar molecules, like oils or fats.  At the molecular level, polar and non-polar molecules will repel each other – which makes them thermodynamically unstable.  As a result, the molecules will begin to align such that there is minimal contact between the polar and non-polar molecules.  This is the precise reason why oil and water mixed together will eventually separate in to two layers.  Prior to forming a full-on layer, though, the oil will form micelles.  You can see the spherical oil micelles form if you shake up a bottle of oil and water.\nThe Milk\nMilk is considered an emulsion of fat, protein, and lactose in water.  In all milk types, the fat is present in micelles that are composed of both saturated and unsaturated fats.  Cow milk has very large fat globules compared to other mammals.  Since these can be hard to digest, most dairies will homogenize the milk.  This results in much smaller, emulsified fat globules that don’t float to the top of the container to form a cream layer.  In addition to the fat micelles, there are also casein micelles.  These are much smaller globs that contain calcium phosphate (CaP) inside.  In an animal, these micelles are meant to carry the CaP to the infant’s stomach.\nOur goal is to get the micelles interacting with each other so that they will coagulate and form a gel (the curds).  We can do this using one of the following methods.\nEnzyme-Mediated Coagulation\nThis process involves the use of rennet, which is used to make most cheeses.  Rennet can be composed of one or more proteases, including pepsin, chymosin, and proteses derived from microbes such as Mucor miehei.  When they are added to the milk, they begin to break up the portions of the casein protein that sticks out of the micelle surface.  These portions of the protein are what keeps the the hydrophobic micelles floating around in the milk.  When they are removed, the micelles become incredibly unstable.  The only way for them to stabilize is to start interacting with each other, thereby reducing the amount of the micelle that is exposed to the rest of the milk.  This forms a gel matrix “net” which traps all the very large fat globules floating around.  If properly done, the whey will be almost perfectly clear and all the curds will form a mass that floats at the top of the cheese vat.\nAcid-Mediated Coagulation\nIn this process, the pH of the milk drops to the acidic range (pH < 4.6).  This alters the interaction of the calcium phosphate molecules with the micelles, and they begin to leak out of the globs.  Once this happens, the micelles become destabilized and begin to interact with each other, forming a gel matrix.  The source of the acid can be exogenous (directly adding acid such as citric acid or vinegar to the milk) or endogenous (from the lactic acid produced by bacteria).\nTemperature-Mediated Coagulation\nSaying that temperature is the primary mechanism involved in this process is kind of a misnomer, since it also involves acid.  If you wanted to, you could simply heat up a vat of milk to boiling and get precipitated curds.  However, I would not recommend doing that because the milk ends up tasting burnt and you have a vat of burnt cheese.  Gross.  So we add acid to the milk (making a pH of about 5) to help the process along and lower the temperature at which the curds begin to coagulate.\nSo there you have it – a crash course in the science of milk coagulation.  The method that you choose determines what type of cheese you will be making.  For instance, using heat to coagulate will kill off all the microorganisms in your milk.  This is bad news for cheeses such as swiss and camembert, which rely on additional microorganisms munching away at the cheese during the ripening process.  However, temperature-coagulated cheeses are ready in under a few hours whereas the rennet-coagulated cheeses usually require months of aging time.\nNo matter the method, though, coagulation of milk micelles is an excellent example of how pH, temperature, and proteases can affect protein-protein interactions.\nReferences:\nCheese: Chemistry, Physics, and Microbiology, Volume 1.

Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\nThursday 2 June 2016 07.50 EDT\nLast modified on Thursday 2 June 2016 19.50 EDT\nClose\nThis article is 8 months old\nManchester United want José Mourinho to stay beyond his three-year contract and establish a dynasty at the club, despite the Portuguese’s record of never being in one place for more than three full seasons in any of his previous jobs.\nMourinho is also intent on managing United in the long term and indicated this to Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, during last week’s negotiations when he finalised his deal in London.\nJosé Mourinho more of a risk for Manchester United than three years ago | Paul Wilson\nRead more\nWhile Sir Alex Ferguson managed United between November 1986 and May 2013, David Moyes was sacked after only 34 games. This was despite the Scot being handed a six-year contract in the hope he could continue the stability and extended success established by Ferguson.\nLouis van Gaal, who was sacked last Monday by Woodward , did not serve the full three years of his deal either, leaving after only two years.\nYet these failures have not dissuaded the United executive from the plan for a long-term manager and the club are of a mind that Mourinho can provide this.\nUnited is the seventh job of the 53-year-old’s 16-season management career. The longest he has stayed was at Chelsea during his first tenure. There he served three full terms before being sacked by them for the first time in September 2007.\nAt Porto, between 2002-04, and Internazionale, 2008-10, Mourinho departed after two seasons, after winning the European Cup each time in the second term. At Real Madrid, from 2010-13, there were three full seasons and at Chelsea from 2013 to December of last year there were two and a half terms, while there was the 2001-02 campaign at União de Leiria, plus nine games at Benfica in 2000, in a truncated first position of Mourinho’s career.\nNow, he is determined to stay at United, much as he was previously at Chelsea for his second spell. In summer 2013 Mourinho described himself as the “Happy One” and the following December talked of a 12-year tenure at the club.\n“I would like [to stay for], say, 12 years,” he said then. “The best way to [run a club] is to do it with stability. For the players, if you want to help them grow up, you do that much better with stability: in ideas, philosophy, model of play, style of leadership. This all comes from stability at the highest level: with the owners and board and, after that, the manager, the second line of the hierarchy. That stability is very important. You look, for example, to Manchester United and everybody feels David [Moyes] will have his time to do his work in a calm way. I think that’s fantastic.”\nMoreover, the comments Mourinho made in his first interview on being announced as manager, to the club’s in-house channel, MUTV, hinted at his desire to lead United into a new era of prolonged success.\nHe spoke of the “empathy” he already has for United and of how there is a determination to give everything for his new club. The manner of his sacking by Chelsea in December , which came after it became evident the title defence was going to be a particular failure, has made the Portuguese ever more determined to show he can be successful in the United job, which he has long coveted.\nMourinho hoped to be appointed when Ferguson announced he was stepping down three years ago but he was passed over for Moyes. Sir Bobby Charlton had previously told the Guardian he was unsure if Mourinho was the right kind of manager for United and that Ferguson did not like him “too much”.\nIf United and Mourinho are to have a long-term relationship, he can be expected to keep relations cordial with Ferguson and Charlton, who remain on the board as directors.\nMourinho will take charge of the squad for the first time in early July. The club may wait until then for his official unveiling.\nQuestion:\nJose Mourinho was appointed manager of which football club September to December 2000 - his first managerial post?\nAnswer:\n",

But we are at liberty to disclose that Graham Greene called it the \"finest spy story ever written,\" and that the taut tale concerns Alec Leamas, a British agent in early Cold War Berlin. Leamas is responsible for keeping the double agents under his care undercover and alive, but East Germans start killing them, so he gets called back to London by Control, his spy master. Yet instead of giving Leamas the boot, Control gives him a scary assignment: play the part of a disgraced agent, a sodden failure everybody whispers about. Control sends him back out into the cold--deep into Communist territory to checkmate the bad-guy spies on the other side. The political chessboard is black and white, but in human terms the vicinity of the Berlin Wall is a moral no-man's land, a gray abyss patrolled by pawns.\nLe Carré beats most spy writers for two reasons. First, he knows what he's talking about, since he raced around working for British Intelligence while the Wall went up. He's familiar with spycraft's fascinations, but also with the fact that it leaves ideals shaken and emotions stirred. Second, his literary tone has deep autobiographical roots. Spying is about betrayal, and Le Carré was abandoned by his mother and betrayed by his father, a notorious con man. (They figure heavily in his novels Single & Single and A Perfect Spy .) In a world of lies, Le Carré writes the bitter truth: it's every man for himself.

    "input": "Passage:\nParker's Piece\nParker's Piece is a 25 acre flat and roughly square green common located near the centre of Cambridge, England and is now regarded as the birthplace of the rules of Association Football.  The two main walking and cycling paths across it run diagonally, and the single lamp-post at the junction is colloquially known as Reality Checkpoint. The area is bounded by Park Terrace, Parkside, Gonville Place, and Regent Terrace. The Cambridge University Football Club Laws were first used on Parker's Piece and adopted by the Football Association in 1863. \"They embrace the true principles of the game, with the greatest simplicity\" (E. C. Morley, F.A. Hon. Sec. 1863). 'The Cambridge Rules appear to be the most desirable for the Association to adopt' (C. W. Alcock 1863, FA committee member and founder of the FA Cup). A statue was due to be erected in October 2013 to celebrate the 150th anniversary on the Football Association and their adoption of the Cambridge Rules, but has been delayed. \n\nThe grass is well manicured and it is known today chiefly as a spot for picnics and games of football and cricket, and serves as the games field for nearby Parkside Community College.  Fairs tend to be held on the rougher ground of Midsummer Common.\n\nIn 1838, a feast for 15,000 guests was held on Parker's Piece to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore 1613, the site of Parker's Piece was owned by Trinity College. In that year, the college exchanged the land — at that time located well outside the town — with the town of Cambridge for the majority of Garret Hostel Green, an island on the River Cam, and the site of the current Wren Library, Trinity College. It was subsequently named after a college cook, Edward Parker, who obtained the rights to farm on it.\n\nAs a cricket ground, Parker's Piece was used for first-class matches from 1817 to 1864. \n\nIn the 19th century, it was one of the principal sports grounds used by students at the University of Cambridge and the site of numerous Varsity Matches against Oxford.\n\nParker's Piece and football\n\nIn the 19th century, football was also commonly played on this ground, as is described in the following quotation from George Corrie, Master of Jesus College (1838):  \"In walking with Willis we passed by Parker's Piece and there saw some forty Gownsmen playing at football. The novelty and liveliness of the scene were amusing!\" \n\nRules of football\n\nParker's Piece has a special place in the history of modern football games, as it was here that the Cambridge Rules of 1848 were first put into practice.  They were very influential in the creation of the modern rules of Association Football, drawn up in London by The Football Association in 1863.  A plaque has been mounted at Parker's Piece bearing the following inscription: \n\nModern passing tactics\n\nThe move by the Cambridge University AFC away from Parker's Piece in 1882 coincided with the side's significant role in the development of the modern passing, combination game. In a detailed investigation into the evolution of football tactics based upon contemporary accounts, Adrian Harvey refers to the teams responsible for the early development of the passing game (including Sheffield, The Royal Engineers   and Queens Park) but comes to the following conclusion about the finished, modern team product:  \"Curiously, the side that was generally credited with transforming the tactics of association football and almost single-handedly inventing the modern game was not a professional team but the Cambridge University XI of 1882.  Contemporaries described Cambridge as being the first \"combination\" team in which each player was allotted an area of the field and played as part of a team in a game that was based upon passing\".   In a discussion by CW Alcock on the history of a \"definite scheme of attack\" and  \"elaborate combination\" in football playing style, he states in 1891:  \"The perfection of the system which is in vogue at the present time however is in a very great measure the creation of the last few years.  The Cambridge University eleven of 1882 were the first to illustrate the full possibilities of a systematic combination giving full scope to the defence as well as the attack\" \n\nProposed sculpture\n\nIn May 2013, the Cambridge City Council proposed that a 2 m statue by artist Gordon Young, in the form of a Subbuteo referee on top of a circular plinth engraved with Cambridge Rules be installed on Parker's Piece to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of the 1863 Football Association rules and Parker's Piece's association with it.  The proposal was rejected in June 2013 before public consultation due to negative feedback and concerns with Hasbro, which markets Subbuteo, and the possibility of significantly exceeding its original £88,000 budget. \n\nTrial lighting\n\nFor a four-week trial beginning January 2013, lighting bollards were temporarily installed along the northwest path, between Reality Checkpoint and Melbourne Place, as residents and students had claimed that Parker's Piece was unsafe after dark. Several attacks had previously occurred in the park.  \n\nParkside\n\nParkside is the street on the north-east side of the park. Since 2006  it has been the terminus for long distance coach services (such as the Stagecoach bus route X5 to Oxford), visitor coaches and a stopping point for local bus services. The street is also home to the city's police station, as well as giving access to Parkside Community College.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:ISH WC Cambridge15.jpg|Looking towards Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church\nImage:Cambridge_Parkers_Piece_Catholic_Church.jpg|The Catholic church of Our Lady and the English Martyrs viewed from Parker's Piece.\nImage:Cambridge_Race_For_Life_2011_Parkers_Piece.jpg|Race for Life 2011 at Parker's Piece.

The original studio using that name was founded in 1919 by D. W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, with the intention of controlling their own interests rather than depending upon the powerful commercial studios.\nThe current United Artists formed in November 2006 under a partnership between producer/actor Tom Cruise and his production partner, Paula Wagner, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paula Wagner left the studio on August 14, 2008. Cruise owned a small stake in the studio until late 2011. It is now a fully owned subsidiary of MGM, which itself is owned by MGM Holdings.\nStarting in 1958 (the year a.a.p.  shut down), United Artists became the owners of the a.a.p. library of pre- August 1948 Looney Tunes cartoons (which were technically under UA's television division). When United Artists was acquired by MGM in 1981, the rights to the pre- August 1948 Looney Tunes went to MGM.\nDue to UA not having interest in renewing copyright, a handful of pre-1944 shorts have fallen into the public domain as a result of their actions. Turner has access to the original negatives and have restored some of these cartoons on DVD and Blu-Ray although the restored print is the original negative, thus it is still in the public domain.\nQuestion:\nThe original United Artists film studio was founded in 1919 by D.W.

Instead, it concerns the future of the programme itself.\nJulian Fellowes, the creator of Downton, has suggested that the next series of the ITV1 drama may be its last.\nIn an interview, the screenwriter admitted there was no way he could continue to write the show’s storylines at the same time as working on his next major project – to create what has been described as an American version of the series.\nThe Gilded Age, to be set in New York in the late 19th century, has been commissioned by the US network, NBC Universal, but its production is being held up by Fellowes’s continuing commitment to Downton, which is due to return for a fifth series later this year.\nFellowes, however, who was elevated to the peerage in 2011, has now indicated that this series could be the last.\nRelated Articles\nDownton Abbey, Christmas special, review: sweet but uneventful\n25 Dec 2013\nHe dropped his bombshell during an interview in the US, last week. Asked about The Gilded Age, he said: “It will happen when Downton finishes, because I just couldn’t do both at once.”\nWhen pressed on whether this meant there would still be a fifth series of Downton, he added: “Yes. I don’t know yet if there is a season six, but it’s not going to go on forever. It won’t be Perry Mason.”\nFellowes has combined his Downton duties with writing a second period drama in the past.\nHowever, the resulting series, Titanic, in 2012, was received with markedly less favour than the ongoing saga of the Crawley family.\nNews of Downton Abbey’s possible demise will alarm fans of the show, as well as managers at ITV, where it has been one of the channel’s biggest successes of recent years, coping with the loss of some of its leading characters as actors have departed, among them Dan Stevens, who played Matthew Crawley, and Jessica Brown Findlay, who played Lady Sybil.\nThe most recent series, which ended in the autumn, had average viewing figures of 11.8 million, and the Christmas Day special was watched by about seven million. Since its beginning in 2010, the show has been sold in more than 220 territories worldwide and has been a notable success in the US, becoming the highest-rated drama series in the history of its broadcaster, PBS.\nIts popularity there has led to heightened interest in The Gilded Age project, and it emerged last February that Fellowes had signed up to write and produce the drama.\nThe new series takes its name from the period of US history from the 1870s to the turn of the 20th century, an era of great social and technological change, as well as rapid economic growth, especially in the north and west of the country.\nThe term was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in an 1873 novel they wrote to satirise what they saw as the greed and corruption of the time. Fellowes’s project will explore the rise of newly rich families who emerged during the period – some of whom became known as “robber barons” – and replaced the older, established aristocracy.\nAs with the British series, the main characters will be fictional. It had been suggested that Fellowes could hand over the main Downton Abbey writing responsibilities to others, to allow him to concentrate on US show.\nBut his latest comments, in The Wall Street Journal, have made clear he does not see that as an option.\nFellowes writes the scripts for Downton alone, although he said in the US interview that he bounces ideas off his wife. “She gets to read [the scripts] first. It only goes off to my agent after it’s been through her,” he said.\nThe last series caused controversy over a storyline in which Anna, the housemaid played by Joanna Froggatt, was raped by a guest’s valet. ITV received 200 complaints after the episode on Oct 6, while Ofcom, the media watchdog, received 250.\nOfcom decided not to pursue the complaints “after careful assessment … because they did not raise issues warranting investigation”.\nQuestion:\nWho writes the scripts for the TV series Downton Abbey?\nAnswer:\n",

It was the first time that the left-wing terrorist group had directly struck the Italian government, marking the beginning of tensions that lasted for 10 years.\nThe Red Brigades were founded by college student Renato Curcio in 1969 to battle “against the imperialist state of the multinationals.” At first, the fledgling organization restricted its activities to small acts of vandalism and arson. However, in 1972, they abducted business executive Idalgo Macchiarini, releasing him a short time later with a sign that said, “Hit one to educate 100. Power to the armed populace.” The Red Brigades kidnapped several other executives in the years following.\nThe kidnapping of Mario Sossi marked the first time that the Red Brigades demanded a ransom: They insisted on the release of eight imprisoned members. After fellow prosecutor Francesco Coco agreed to the demand, Sossi was released. However, Coco reneged on the deal and infuriated the Red Brigades.\nOver the next several years, the terrorist group kidnapped 26 wealthy men and women to fund their criminal enterprises, extorting as much as $2 million for one abduction. They also got revenge on Coco, killing him in 1976. That same year, 49 members were prosecuted in Turin, prompting several retaliatory shootings against government officials.\nIn 1978, the ante was upped even further after some of the Red Brigades’ leaders were arrested. Aldo Moro, a former Italian prime minister, was kidnapped on March 16, 1978, and five bodyguards were killed in the attack. For 55 days, the terrorists made various demands while taunting Moro’s family with fake death announcements. On May 9, after their demands were refused, Moro’s body was found in the trunk of a red car in the middle of Rome. He had been shot 11 times in the chest. The Red Brigades killed seven more politicians in the next week, terrorizing the whole country of Italy.\nSixty-three persons ended up being charged with involvement in Moro’s murder. Prospero Gallinari, the actual shooter, and 22 others were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Red Brigades were finally crushed in the early 1980s when over 400 members were jailed.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nWhich former Italian Prime Minister was kidnapped by The Red Brigade in 1978, and killed after 55 days in captivity?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nLimpopo River\nThe Limpopo River rises in central southern Africa, and flows generally eastwards to the Indian Ocean. The term Limpopo is the modified version of the original Sepedi name diphororo tša meetse, meaning ″gushing strong waterfalls\". The river is approximately 1750 km long, with a drainage basin 415000 km2 in size. The mean discharge measured over a year is 170 m3/s (6,200 cu ft/s) at its mouth.  The Limpopo is the second largest river in Africa that drains to the Indian Ocean, after the Zambezi River.\n\nThe first European to sight the river was Vasco da Gama, who anchored off its mouth in 1498 and named it Espiritu Santo River. Its lower course was explored by St. Vincent Whitshed Erskine in 1868–69, and Captain J.F. Elton traveled down its middle course in 1870.\n\nCourse \n\nThe Limpopo River flows in a great arc, first zigzagging north and then northeast, then turning east and finally southeast. It serves as a border for about 640 km, separating South Africa to the southeast from Botswana to the northwest and Zimbabwe to the north. Two of its tributaries, the Marico River and the Crocodile River join, at which point the name changes to Limpopo River. There are several rapids as the river falls off Southern Africa's inland escarpment.\n\nThe Notwane River is a major tributary of the Limpopo, rising on the edge of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana and flowing in a north-easterly direction.  The main tributary of the Limpopo, the Olifants River (Elephant River), contributes around 1,233 million m3 of water per year.Görgens, A.H.M. and Boroto, R.A. 1997. Limpopo River: flow balance anomalies, surprises and implications for integrated water resources management. In: Proceedings of the 8th South African National Hydrology Symposium, Pretoria, South Africa. Other major tributaries include the Shashe River, Mzingwane River, Crocodile River, Mwenezi River and Luvuvhu River. \n\nIn the north-eastern corner of South Africa the river borders the Kruger National Park.\n\nThe port town of Xai-Xai, Mozambique is on the river near the mouth. Below the Olifants, the river is permanently navigable to the sea, though a sandbar prevents access by large ships except at high tide.\n\nTributaries\n\nLeft hand\n\n*Notwane River\n*Bonwapitse River\n*Mahalapswe River\n*Lotsane River\n*Motloutse River\n*Shashe River\n*Umzingwani River\n*Bubi River\n*Mwenezi River\n*Changane River\n\nRight hand\n\n*Marico River\n*Crocodile River\n*Matlabas River\n*Mokolo River\n*Palala River\n*Mogalakwena River\n*Kolope River\n*Sand River (Limpopo)\n*Nwanedi River\n*Luvuvhu River\n*Olifants River (Limpopo)\n\nBasin characteristics \n\nThe waters of the Limpopo flow sluggishly, with considerable silt content. Rainfall is seasonal and unreliable: in dry years, the upper parts of the river flow for 40 days or less. The upper part of the drainage basin, in the Kalahari Desert, is arid but conditions become less arid further downriver. The next reaches drain the Waterberg Massif, a biome of semi-deciduous forest and low-density human population.  About 14 million people live in the Limpopo basin. The fertile lowlands support a denser population. Flooding during the rainy season is an occasional problem in the lower reaches. During February 2000 heavy rainfalls (due to a cyclone) caused the catastrophic 2000 Mozambique flood.\n\nThe highest concentration of hippopotamus in the Limpopo River is found between the Mokolo and the Mogalakwena Rivers. \n\nThere is a lot of mining activity in the Limpopo River basin with about 1,900 mines, not counting about 1,700 abandoned mines. \n\nHistory \n\nVasco da Gama and his first expedition, probably the first Europeans to sight the river, anchored off the mouth in 1498. However, there has been human habitation in the region since time immemorial — sites in the Makapans Valley near Mokopane contain Australopithecus fossils from 3.5 million years ago. St Vincent Whitshed Erskine, later Surveyor General for South Africa, was the first European to travel down the length of the Limpopo river to its mouth in 1868.\n\nThe British author Rudyard Kipling popularized the Limpopo in his short story \"The Elephant's Child\", in the Just So Stories, in which he described \"the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees,\" where the \"Bi-Coloured Python Rock-Snake\" dwells. \n\nA Zambezi shark (Carcharhinus leucas) was caught hundreds of kilometres upriver at the confluence of the Limpopo and Luvuvhu Rivers in July 1950. Zambezi sharks tolerate fresh water and can travel far up the Limpopo. \n\nIn 2013, approximately 15,000 crocodiles were released into the Limpopo River from flood gates at the nearby Rakwena Crocodile Farm.\nQuestion:\nThe Limpopo River separates Zimbabwe and Botswana from what country?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nBorscht\nBorscht is a tart soup popular in several East European cuisines, including Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Romanian and Ashkenazi Jewish. The variety most commonly associated with the name in English is of Ukrainian origin and includes beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which gives the dish a distinctive red color. It shares the name, however, with a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht, cabbage borscht, etc.\n\nBorscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed, a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables, which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a dainty clear broth or a smooth refreshing drink. It is often served with smetana or sour cream, hard-boiled eggs and/or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes, such as ' or ', that can be served with the soup.\n\nIts popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire, and – by way of migration – to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites, the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Today, several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its variegated local guises, as their own national dish and consume it as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman Catholic, and Jewish religious traditions.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe English word borscht, also spelled borsch, borsht, or bortsch, comes from Yiddish  ('). The latter derives from the word  ('), which is common to East Slavic languages, such as Ukrainian or Russian. Together with cognates in other Slavic languages, it comes from Proto-Slavic *bŭrščǐ 'hogweed' and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bhr̥sti- Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore political boundaries ... The faint outline of the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main ingredient of borscht soup?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nGarnish (food)\nA garnish is an item or substance used as a decoration or embellishment accompanying a prepared food dish or drink. In many cases, it may give added or contrasting flavor.  Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.  This is in contrast to a condiment, a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being garni, the French term for 'garnished.'  Many garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so.  Parsley is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green herb has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\nOverview\n\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.  They may, for example, enhance their color, such as when paprika is sprinkled on a salmon salad. They may give a color contrast, for example when chives are sprinkled on potatoes. They may make a cocktail more visually appealing, such as when a cocktail umbrella is added to an exotic drink, or when a Mai Tai is topped with any number of tropical fruit pieces. Sushi may be garnished with baran, a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an entrée could be topped with a sauce, as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a banana split sundae with cherries on top or buffalo wings served with celery stick garnish and blue cheese dressing.\n\nGarnishes\n\nClassic French garnishes include \n \nFor soups:\n* Brunoise - one to three mm diced vegetables\n* Chiffonade - finely shredded lettuce or sorrel stewed in butter \n* Croutes - small pieces of halved French bread buttered and oven dried\n* Coulis - (a thicker soup) drizzled decoratively\n* Croutons - small pieces of bread (typically cubes) fried in butter or other oil   \n* Julienne - thinly sliced vegetables\n* Pasta (tapioa, sago, salep) etc. \n* Pluches -a whole leaf spray of herbs, without the central stalk (traditionally chervil)\n* Profiterolles - puff pastry stuffed with purée\n* Royale - a small decoratively shaped piece of egg custard (in German this is called an Eierstich)\n* Threaded eggs\nand for relevés and entrées:\n* Croquettes\n* Potatoes (pommes dauphine, Duchess potatoes or Marquis)\n* Duxelles - fried onion, mushrooms and herbs\n* Matignon - minced carrots, onions, and celeries with ham stewed in butter and Madeira\n* Mirepoix - similar to Matignon but diced (cf. minced) with or without ham (or with bacon substituted for the ham)\n* Salpicon - a variety of other diced meats or vegetables\n* Fritters \n\nTools often used for creating food garnishes include skewers, knives, graters, toothpicks, and parchment cones. \n\n \nFile:Garnished crabcake.jpg|A crabcake with a cream sauce and a garnish of microgreens\nFile:Cheese tray garnished with red pepper rings and chicory.jpg|Cheese tray garnished with red pepper rings and chicory\nQuestion:\n\"A dish cooked \"\"a la Lyonnaise\"\" would be garnished or prepared with which ingredient?\"\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nDes Moines, the U.S. Insurance Capital - Free Enterprise\nDes Moines, the U.S. Insurance Capital\nThe Insurance Capital of the U.S.? Look to Des Moines\nFree Enterprise Staff | January 29, 2015\nThere are hundreds of metropolitan areas in the United States, each of which has become increasingly specialized and known for its strength in a particular industry or sector. In the diverse economy of Des Moines, Iowa, that specialty would be insurance.\nDes Moines is, after all, a global hub of the insurance industry, trailing only Hartford, Connecticut and megacities like New York. All told, the insurance industry accounts for roughly 16% of the region’s jobs , with more than 80 such businesses requiring all kinds of skilled workers and laborers. How does a city roughly 43 times smaller than the Big Apple maintain such a vaunted position in the sector’s pecking order of urban centers?\nLured initially by its economic history and favorable state taxation policy, conglomerates such as ING and Nationwide quickly recognized that the cost of doing business in Des Moines is often significantly less expensive than New York, for example, where an amalgam of federal, state, and local taxes often proves to be prohibitively costly, particularly for companies operating within heavily taxed and regulated industries like insurance and finance.\nWhat is specialized insurance and why has it become the bread and butter of Des Moines’s burgeoning economy? As Matt Anderson, the city’s assistant general manager, told Free Enterprise in a recent interview , specialized insurance is available to essentially any kind of business. “We have a lot of specialized insurance companies, with ones focused primarily on insuring things like chiropractors and churches. Since there’s only a handful of companies out there doing it, you can essentially grow a big business out here by specialization,” Anderson explained.\nALSO ON F REE ENTERPRISE: Des Moines Emerges as an Economic Hub\n“In addition to very large firms such as Principal Financial Group and Employers Mutual Company, which have been headquartered in Des Moines for over 100 years,  ING and Nationwide also have strong presences out here, which has helped a lot in terms of creating a stable jobs market. They initially acquired some Des Moines-based insurance companies, but they quickly realized we have a low cost to doing business, and we have a very educated and productive workforce.”\nAs Anderson tells it, Des Moines and the state of Iowa have not rested on their laurels. While lawmakers at the state level continue to work to hone policy and adjust the regulatory environment to attract more new businesses, Des Moines also actively works to lure companies from across the state. At the heart of this movement sits the Greater Des Moines Partnership , a public-private organization that, according to Anderson, acts as a kind of economic development group “on steroids.”\nThe Greater Des Moines Partnership recruits new businesses and urges existing companies to bolster their local presence. Since 1999, in fact, the public-private partnership has played a hand in helping more than 450 projects that either expanded or moved to the metro area. In total, such development has generated more than 23,000 jobs, according to the group , all while attracting nearly 150 new businesses. The Greater Des Moines Partnership is also able to offer companies contemplating a move to the Des Moines metro area a host of services otherwise not available—providing help with everything from finance and human resources to real estate and marketing.\nThanks to its strong education system, its educated workforce, and its well-run government— USA Today ranked Iowa as the fourth best-run state in the U.S. in 2014 —companies don’t just move to Des Moines, they expand. The Principal Financial Group , for instance, is currently investing more than $400 million to completely renovate its corporate offices in downtown Des Moines, a move that’ll likely lure additional investment and residents over the coming decade.\nThough it’s benefited from its history, Des Moines is a testament to the possibilities that can come when public and private groups collaborate in an effort to continually drive economic growth and improve the standard of living. It doesn’t take long to see how these kinds of investments are paying off: In various lists compiled by Forbes Magazine, Des Moines ranked as the top city for young professionals , the best for up-and-coming downtown areas , and the second-best for jobs .\nNeither the state’s business community nor its government agencies have any intention of losing those distinctions anytime soon. Taxes are low for a number of industries—aside from a 1% insurance premium tax, the state has no premium taxes on the sale of annuities, qualified insurance plans, or surtaxes on insurance carriers, among other favorable policies—and both the state and local organizations are beefing up their investment in infrastructure and services.\nThe Des Moines strategy is paying off: Among others, Symetra Financial Corp. announced last year that it would move operations to Iowa after it encountered an unfavorable regulatory climate in its home state of Washington. “We’re looking for a level playing field to more effectively compete with other life insurance companies,” a Symetra spokeswoman told Bloomberg News of the company’s major decision .\nWith more and more businesses—particularly insurance and financial services companies—taking the plunge and moving to Des Moines, and public and private organizations working together to create a better business environment, city and state lawmakers are confident that Des Moines will continue to cement its position as a go-to hub of industry and innovation.\nThis is the first part of our multi-installment, year-long #SiliconCitiesUSA Series \nWhat Is #SiliconCitiesUSA?\nOver the course of this year, we’ll explore how entrepreneurs and businesses are faring in non-major U.S. cities, beginning with Des Moines, Iowa. We’ll be reporting on the ground from each city, talking with elected officials and business leaders about how they’re harnessing their unique resources and local talent to fuel economic growth and better compete against more established urban centers like San Francisco and New York City.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the capital of the U.S. state of Connecticut?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nShark (TV series)\nShark is an American legal drama created by Ian Biederman that originally aired on CBS from September 21, 2006 to May 20, 2008. The series stars James Woods.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe show revolves around Sebastian Stark (Woods), a notorious Los Angeles defense attorney who becomes disillusioned with his career after his successful defense of a wife-abuser results in the wife's death; after more than a month trying to come to grips with his situation, he is invited by the Los Angeles district attorney to become a public prosecutor so he can apply his unorthodox-but-effective talents to putting guilty people away instead of putting them back on the street. Stark's relationship with the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, his staff, and his daughter, forms the central plot for the series.\n\nCast members\n\nCharacters\n\n* Sebastian Stark: A confident and stern former high end defense attorney. Stark was recruited to the DA's office by the mayor after a client he had previously defended against assault charges killed his (the client's) wife just a few days later. Despite his realization after this case, his methods as a defense attorney have not been changed dramatically in his role as a prosecutor.\n* Jessica Devlin: Los Angeles District Attorney for 14 years, Devlin was Stark's boss for the duration of the season one. When she was defeated in an election, however, Stark hired her as the Senior Member of his team.\n* Leo Cutler: Los Angeles District Attorney second season.\n* Madeline Poe: Poe was the only voluntary member of Stark's original team. She had the highest conviction rate of the entire DA's office in the last two years prior to the show's start, and arguably the best lawyer of Stark's original team.\n* Casey Woodland: A young, handsome lawyer from an influential family, Casey finds himself having to prove his worth to those who think he bought his way into the job. He begins a sexual relationship with Madeline Poe in spite of their disdain for each other.\n* Raina Troy: Troy is passionate, smart and tough, and described by Stark as \"brilliant\" but \"a contempt citation waiting to happen.\" Midway through the first season she begins a relationship with Isaac Wright.\n* Danny Reyes: Reyes was transferred from the gang-crime unit, and used past experience to influence his motives. He often conflicts with Stark and Jessica, both of whom privately agree that he is a very good lawyer.\n* Isaac Wright: A former LAPD officer, Stark offered him a job on his team after Wright resigned from LAPD because he planted evidence in the home of a suspect in an effort to arrest his partner's killer.\n* Julie Stark: The daughter of Sebastian, she decided to stay with her father after her custody hearing, because \"he needs her more than he'll ever know.\"\n* Wayne Callison: A serial killer, creative writing teacher and Stark's personal nemesis throughout season 1. He targeted emotionally damaged women in their 20s and tortured them to death by cutting them. After he is acquitted, Stark becomes obsessed with putting him behind bars.\n\nShark's rules\n\n*Trial is War. Second place is death.\n*Truth is relative. Pick one that works.\n*In a jury trial, there are only 12 opinions that matter and yours (speaking to his team) is not one of them.\n\nEpisodes\n\nBroadcast history\n\nThe show first aired in the 10:00 p.m., Eastern Thursday night slot. On October 20, 2006, it was announced that CBS had picked up the show for a full 22-episode season. \nCBS announced on May 16, 2007 that Shark would return for a second season. \n\nIn Shark's second season, it moved to Sunday night at 10:00 p.m., switching timeslots with Without a Trace and thereby competing against another highly rated series, ABC's Brothers & Sisters. In Canada, Global had also picked up Brothers & Sisters, so they decided to keep Shark on Thursday 10 p.m. timeslot, three days ahead of the CBS broadcast (except for the Season 2 premiere), and Brothers & Sisters for their Sunday night 10 p.m. timeslot.\n\nThe show returned Tuesday April 29, 2008 in a new timeslot at 9:00 p.m. to air the four remaining post-strike episodes.  CBS officially cancelled the series on May 13, 2008. \n\nFilming locations\n\nShark was filmed mostly in and around Hollywood and Los Angeles in California. Many Hollywood landmarks can be seen including Hollywood Boulevard and the Hollywood Hills. There were roof top scenes shot at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, and exterior and interior shots at the Vibe Hotel both located on Hollywood Boulevard .\n\nRatings\n\nDVD release\n\nSyndication\n\nShark began airing on Ion in early 2010 late Sundays (10 p.m.-Midnight in a two episode block) but was later canceled except for marathons held holiday weekends.\n\nInternational airings\n\nIn Australia Shark started airing season 2 at 10pm on Thursdays from November 12, 2009, on Seven's new digital channel 7TWO. Season 2l and the series overall completed its first run airing on W on Friday, December 18.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Shark was shown at 11.00 am every weekday on Channel 5.\nQuestion:\nThe American legal drama Shark ran from Sept 06 to May 08.

Please try again later.\nPublished on Feb 14, 2014\n\"On the Street Where You Live\" is a song with music by Frederick Loewe and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner from the 1956 Broadway musical My Fair Lady. It is sung in the musical by the character Freddy Eynsford-Hill, who was portrayed by John Michael King in the original production. In the 1964 film version, it was sung by Bill Shirley, dubbing for actor Jeremy Brett.\nThe most popular single of the song was recorded by Vic Damone in 1956 for Columbia Records. It reached #4 on the Billboard magazine charts and #6 on Cash Box magazine's chart. It was a #1 hit in the UK in 1958.\nIn 1955, Damone had only one song on the charts, \"Por Favor,\" which did not make it above #73. However, he did have major roles in two movie musicals, Hit the Deck and Kismet. In early 1956, he moved from Mercury to Columbia Records and had some success on that label with hits like \"On the Street Where You Live\" (from My Fair Lady, his final pop top ten) and \"An Affair to Remember\" (from the movie of the same name). His six original, long-playing albums on Columbia between 1957 and 1961 were That Towering Feeling, Angela Mia, Closer Than a Kiss, This Game of Love, On the Swingin' Side and Young and Lively.\nOh, the towering feeling\nJust to know somehow you are near\nI have often walked on this street before\nBut the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before\nAll at once am I several stories high\nKnowing I'm on the street where you live\nAre there lilac trees in the heart of town\nCan you hear a lark in any other part of town\nDoes enchantment pour out of every door\nNo, it's just on the street where you live\nFor oh, the towering feeling\nJust to know somehow you are near\nThe overpowering feeling\nThat any second you may suddenly appear\nPeople stop and stare, they don't bother me\nFor there's nowhere else on earth\nThat I would rather be\nLet the time go by, I won't care if I\nCan be here on the street where you live\nSound recording administered by SME (thanks for allowing this to remain)\n\"The AUDIO content does not belong to me.

That’s where I grew up, that’s where we commercial fish. Willow is a community there in Alaska. And then Piper, you know, there’s just not too many Pipers out there and it’s a cool name.

Its Web site is gotfootlongs.com .\nLast week, the restaurant got a letter from a lawyer representing Subway, which, as you may have heard, sells 12-inch sandwiches for five bucks.\nAfter explaining that Subway \"has applied for the trademark FOOTLONG (TM) in association with sandwiches,\" the letter says:\nYou are hereby put on notice to cease and desist from using FOOTLONG (TM) association with sandwiches. You must immediately remove all references to FOOTLONG (TM) in association with sandwiches.\n(The full letter is online here .)\nGiven our recent interest in trademark issues — recall the short life and painful death of the Planet Money Money Honey (TM) visor — it seemed worth learning more. So I put in calls to Subway and to Blair Hensley, owner of the Coney Island Drive Inn.\nTurns out, Subway has already recanted the letter.\nIt was a \"clerical error,\" Kevin Kane, a Subway spokesman, told me. Using \"footlong\" for hot dogs is no problem — the company is only trying to trademark the term for sandwiches, Kane said.\nArticle continues after sponsorship\nI asked him how many other footlong-related cease-and-desist letters the company has sent out, but he said he couldn't comment on that.\n\"Any legal process we go through is to protect the investment our franchisees have made in the brand,\" Kane told me. \"If 'footlong' is a name that's been associated with us, it would benefit them that we would take an action like this to protect the association.\"\nThe trademark office will have to weigh that argument against the notion that \"footlong\" is commonly used to describe sandwiches that are 12 inches long, and not the property of one company.\nOr, as Hensley said: \"How can you trademark the word footlong?\"\nHe said he had a photo from 1968 that shows the phrase \"world famous footlongs\" painted on the outside of the building, and a hand-painted menu board from 1963 that says \"footlong specialists.\"\n\"We do have short dogs, but the majority of dogs we sell are footlongs,\" Hensley told me. \"That's why you come here.\"\nSubway's trademark applications for \"footlong\" are online here and here . (The applicant is Doctor's Associates, Inc., which is the name of Subway's parent company. It was founded by a guy who had a Ph.D. and a teenager who wanted to be a doctor.)\nQuestion:\nWhat company made headlines last week by claiming to own a trademark on the word \"footlong\"?\nAnswer:\n",

That compares with 33 last year.\nFlight Options has bought a string of travel firms since it was launched in 1995 as a small tour operator offering seats only on various routes across the Mediterranean.\nA statement on its website read: \"As of 1700hrs on 17 August the Flight Options group of companies have ceased trading.\n\"The Civil Aviation Authority have been informed and we are awaiting further advice on the situation.\"\nFull refunds\nA spokesman for the CAA said: \"We are picking up the pieces.

But the creation of rock 'n' roll and Elvis as king had its origins long before he walked into Sun Studio in Memphis to create the magic. \nThe Elvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo, Mississippi is where it all literally began, and much of the roots of Elvis Presley's exposure to gospel, blues and performance all came together in East Tupelo.\nThe northeastern Mississippi city isn't far from Memphis; in fact, many international visitors to Memphis combine visits to Memphis with Tupelo and some of the blues sites across the northern part of the state. It takes about an hour and a half to drive from Graceland in Memphis to Tupelo, so it's easily done as a day trip.\nThe Elvis birthplace in Tupelo provides a more intimate look at Elvis Aaron Presley, who was born in a tiny house in East Tupelo on Jan. 8, 1935. Elvis, along with his parents Vernon and Gladys, moved to Memphis in 1948 when he was 13.\ncontinue reading below our video\nBest Road Trip Apps\nThe family lived in different locations in Tupelo, but the birthplace is the actual home where Elvis was born, just a few minutes after his twin brother, Jessie, was stillborn.\nThe city bought the house and surrounding property in 1957 when Elvis made his first return back in Tupelo to perform. He donated the proceeds from the concert to purchase the birthplace so that the property could be turned into a public park for the children of East Tupelo who didn't have such facilities.\nTouring the property can take as little as a few minutes or a couple of hours, depending on what is of interest. The Elvis Presley Birthplace Park consists of the birthplace, museum, chapel, gift shop, \"Elvis at 13\" statue, Fountain of Life, Walk of Life, \"Memphis Bound\" car feature, Story Wall and the Assembly of God Church.\nAfter purchasing tickets, visitors tour the grounds on their own and can choose which attraction to visit first. The recommended path is to walk west to the Walk of Life, a scored concrete circle surrounding the birthplace house with a dated granite block denoting every year of Elvis' life. The first 13 years are commemorated with important facts of each year of his time in Tupelo.\nNext to the Mississippi historic site marker for the birthplace is the modest two-room house that was built by Elvis' father, Vernon, with help from his father, Jessie, and brother, Vester. The home is open for tours, and a guide is in the house describing the features of the home and stories of Elvis and his family in Tupelo.\nAfter exiting the home, find the 1948 granite block that points to the Elvis at 13 statue, a life-size replica of what Elvis would have looked like at that age. The sculptor worked from photographs in the property's museum to determine Elvis' facial features, hairline and general body size. The statue was unveiled in August 2002.\nWalk past Mississippi music markers denoting Elvis' contributions to and influences by country and blues music, and find the family's childhood church. The actual building where Elvis was exposed to Southern gospel music was moved to the property from its original location nearby and completely restored. A video plays in the church, giving a feel for what church services were like for Elvis.\nOther nearby sites include the Elvis Presley Memorial Chapel, which was a dream of Elvis' and was dedicated in 1979. A story wall features stories from some of Elvis' childhood friends.\nWalking past the Fountain of Life, enter the Elvis Presley Museum, which was originally opened in 1992 and renovated in 2006. It features the large personal collection of Janelle McComb, a Tupelo resident and long-time friend of the Presley family. It also exhibits Tupelo artifacts. The building also features a large gift shop and event center, that regularly shows a movie on Elvis' life in Tupelo.\nOutside the building pointing northwest toward Memphis is a green 1939 Plymouth sedan, a replica of the car the Presley family drove when leaving Tupelo for Memphis.\nThe birthplace is open Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets can be purchased for the house only, but if time permits it is worth it to buy the full grounds tour.\nQuestion:\nIn what year did Elvis Presley and his parents move from Tupelo to Memphis?\nAnswer:\n",

His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. The real truth, however, was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he wouldn't see his mother again until he was in his late 20s). He left school at fourteen, lying about his age and forging his father's signature on a letter to join Bob Pender's troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the US. Their show on Broadway, \"Good Times,\" ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62. One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style--\"high comedy with polished words.\" In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed. His biggest box-office success was another Hitchcock 1950s film, North by Northwest (1959) made with Eva Marie Saint since Kelly was by that time Princess of Monaco.\nQuestion:\nBritish-born American film actor Archibald Alec Leach was better known by which stage name?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nHair and skin colour. DermNet NZ\nHair and skin colour | DermNet New Zealand\nHome » Topics A–Z » Hair and skin colour\nHair and skin colour\nAuthor: Vanessa Ngan, Staff writer\nThe differences in human skin and hair colour are among the most noticeable features of human variability. An individual’s skin and hair colour provides a clue to their ancestry and heritage. Skin and hair colour is primarily determined by the genes we inherit from our parents. But what is it that makes black skin and red hair?\nGenetics and evolution of hair and skin colour\nSkin colour or pigmentation is determined by three pigments or chromophores:\nMelanin – a brown/black or red/yellow polymer produced by melanosomes in melanocyte cells\nHaemoglobin in red blood cells in the superficial vasculature\nDietary carotenoids (e.g. carrots) – to a much lesser degree, and is often seen as a yellow colour on the palms\nSkin colour\nCarotenaemia\nMelanin content of skin is the main determining factor of skin and hair colour; hair is considered a form of skin with regards to pigmentation. Melanin is synthesized by melanosomes found in skin cells called melanocytes.\nWhether you have dark skin or light skin depends on the amount and type of melanin produced in your skin. There are two types of melanin and the relative amounts of each determine your skin and hair colouring.\nEumelanin is responsible for producing brown or black colour\nPhaeomelanin is responsible for yellow or red colour.\nEumelanin:phaeomelanin ratio\nHigh eumelanin and low phaeomelanin\nBlack or dark skin\nHigh phaeomelanin and low eumelanin\nLight skin and freckles\nRed (very high phaeomelanin) or yellow\nNone or very little eumelanin or pheomelanin (albinism)\nPale\nWhite\nThe table above gives a very simplistic explanation for skin and hair colour determination. Many other factors are involved, including a gene protein called melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R).\nIncreased activity of MC1R leads to the production of more eumelanin and less phaeomelanin, resulting in darkening of skin and hair. People who have impaired MC1R genes tend to have red hair and fair skin with freckles. This gene mutation increases the risk of skin cancer, particularly melanoma .\nChanges in gene activity associated with skin and hair colouring has been occurring since the evolution of mankind. Migration and movement of humans over the continents meant skin colour evolved quickly and readily as an adaptation to new environments.\nVariations of skin and hair colour\nNot only do we see differences in the skin and hair colour between people but sometimes we see differences in the colour between different parts of our own body. Hair colour may vary both in time and site. For example, scalp hair may be blonde in a child, then darken to brown in adolescence, and eventually become white in old age. And why in an individual can scalp hair be black or dark brown whilst facial or pubic hair be red? A number of factors are at work to explain this diversity.\nUltraviolet radiation\nSkin exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet radiation) increases the production of melanin and can result in darker coloured skin (tanning). Repeated exposure to UVR can lead to darker skin and hair colour over time. Sun exposure can also cause brown spots and freckles , especially in fair-skinned individuals.\nPigmentation disorders\nPigmentation disorders can result in generalised or localised hyperpigmentation (increased skin colour) and hypopigmentation (reduced skin colour). Increase in melanin (hyperpigmentation or hypermelanosis) can be due to an increased number of pigment cells (melanocytes) or from increased production of melanin. Whilst a reduction in melanin results in pale patches (hypopigmentation or hypomelanosis) and total loss of melanin in white patches (leucoderma).\nSex, age and site\nThe number of melanocytes and the amount and type of melanin produced may be affected by body site, age and sex in the following ways:\nDifferent body sites are preprogrammed to have differing numbers of melanocytes and constitutive melanin production.\nAmount and type of melanin production vary with age and gender. Children are usually paler skinned than adults, and females paler than males.\nHair and skin melanocytes may show some degree of independence. Skin may be highly pigmented and the hair less so, although this may also depend on body site.\nHair greying\nOne concern of many people is greying hair. Turning grey is partly due to an inherited trait and to aging.\nIf your parents suffer from premature grey hair (getting grey hairs in early 20’s or 30’s) then chances are you will grey sooner rather than later.\nRegardless of inherited genes, most people will start to show signs of greying as they get older. Chances of going grey increases 10-20% every decade after 30 years.\nWith increasing age, melanocyte activity slows down and eventually stops so that melanin (pigment that gives colour to hair) is no longer produced. New hair grows without colour and is transparent hair that gives the appearance of grey hair against healthier darker hair.\nIn some cases, grey hair may be caused by a deficiency of B12 or a thyroid imbalance.\nGrey hair is more obvious in people with darker hair because it stands out, but people with naturally light hair are just as likely to go grey.\nThe genetic factors responsible for pigmentary variations needs further investigation. A better understanding of MC1R and other genes will go a long way to help in explaining the variation in skin and hair color in human populations.\nRelated information\nRees JL.

(Click to expand)\nCurrently China is the second largest producer of the red metal, with an annual output of about 1.6 million tonnes per year, well below the nearly 5.8 million annual tonnes produced by Chile, the world’s leader, based on data provided by CRU Consulting.\nGlobal copper producers —being Chile's Codelco the largest, followed by Freeport-McMoRan, Glencore (LON:GLEN) and BHP Billiton (ASX:BHP)— plan expansions of mine capacity that would add between 1.1m tonnes and 1.3m tonnes of copper per year to the market until 2016.\nSuch increases would be roughly equivalent to the annual output of Chile's Escondida, the world’s largest mine, which provides about 5% of the world supply.\nPeru’s steady growth in recent years has been largely driven by mineral production. Last year the country injected $9.7 billion to the local economy coming from mining, jumping 14% when compared to 2012.\nAuthorities have said  they expect to reach similar levels  by the end of this year, as there is still there is plenty for everyone to get a descent piece of the resources pie.

At 35 years of age, the Georgia-born minister was the youngest person ever to receive the award.\nMartin Luther King, Jr., was born in Atlanta in 1929, the son of a Baptist minister. He received a doctorate degree in theology and in 1955 organized the first major protest of the civil rights movement: the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott. Influenced by Mohandas Gandhi, he advocated nonviolent civil disobedience to racial segregation. The peaceful protests he led throughout the American South were often met with violence, but King and his followers persisted, and their nonviolent movement gained momentum.\nA powerful orator, he appealed to Christian and American ideals and won growing support from the federal government and northern whites. In 1963, he led his massive March on Washington, in which he delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” address. In 1964, the civil rights movement achieved two of its greatest successes: the ratification of the 24th Amendment, which abolished the poll tax, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited racial discrimination in employment and education and outlawed racial segregation in public facilities. In October of that year, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He donated the prize money, valued at $54,600, to the civil rights movement.\nIn the late 1960s, King openly criticized U.S. involvement in Vietnam and turned his efforts to winning economic rights for poor Americans. By that time, the civil rights movement had begun to fracture, with activists such as Stokely Carmichael rejecting King’s vision of nonviolent integration in favor of African American self-reliance and self-defense. In 1968, King intended to revive his movement through an interracial “Poor People’s March” on Washington, but on April 4 he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, by escaped white convict James Earl Ray, just a few weeks before the demonstration was scheduled to begin.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nIn 1964, who became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize?\nAnswer:\n",

The NBC Symphony Orchestra was formed in 1937 expressly for the famed Toscanini, the renowned Italian conductor whose celebrated career included tenures as the music director at Milan's La Scala and New York's Philharmonic Orchestra; although he was already 70 years old at the time he agreed to work at NBC, the years he helmed the orchestra were arguably the most creatively fertile of his life.\nDebuting on Christmas night, 1937, from Studio 8-H at the network's headquarter at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, the NBC Symphony Orchestra comprised a who's who of virtuoso performers, among them viola player William Primrose, violinist Edwin Bachmann and timpanist Karl Glassman; in the years to follow, the ensemble's ranks also included Milton Katims, Samuel Antek, Frank Brieff, Robert La Marchina, Harry Glantz and countless others. Their weekly live performances were justly celebrated by critics and audiences alike, with Toscanini also leading his troops into the studio for a series of well-received recordings. All told, the NBC Symphony Orchestra enjoyed 17 years of success before Toscanini -- age 87 -- finally retired after one last performance on April 4, 1951, bringing a golden era to its close. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi\nHear more of\nQuestion:\nFor which conductor was the NBC Symphony orchestra created in 1937?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nPaddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\nPaddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is a novel by Irish writer Roddy Doyle, first published in 1993 by Secker and Warburg. It won the Booker Prize that year. The story is about a 10-year-old boy living in Barrytown, North Dublin, and the events that happen within his age group, school and home in around 1968.\n\nLanguage and plot structure\n\nThe novel is known for its interesting use of language – Doyle uses a register that gives the reader the vivid impression of listening to a ten-year-old Irish boy from the 1960s. The novel is not divided into chapters but into small scenes which do not follow any chronological order.\n\nThe plot structure of the novel is also unconventional, that of numerous vignettes. Despite the absence of a clear-cut plot (introduction, complication, climax, dénouement) one can still, with certain sensitivities in place, derive a perceptible passing of time as we witness, gradually, how Barrytown changes.\n\nThe novel, chronicling Paddy's internal journey towards maturity, is a bildungsroman as it centres around the main character's development. Paddy's growing up is painfully bitter. While the beginning of the book is filled with playful antics, the growing antagonism between his parents and the breaking up of their marriage are evident as the novel moves on. What makes Paddy's rite of passage, as it were, all the more tragic is the fact that he does not choose his \"journey of enlightenment and maturity\", rather, he is robbed of it when his parents become estranged from one another.\n\nPlot synopsis\n\nPaddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha recounts (approximately) one year in the life of a Dublin ten-year-old, Patrick \"Paddy\" Clarke, especially his relationships with Sinbad (Francis), his younger brother, his parents and his schoolmates and teachers.  It begins with him being a mischievous boy roaming around local Barrytown and ends with his father departing from the family, forcing the boy to take up adult responsibilities in his now single-parent home.\nQuestion:\n\"Who wrote the 1993 Booker Prize winning novel \"\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\n",

The rise in China's net imports of petroleum and other liquids is driven by steady economic growth, with rapidly rising Chinese petroleum demand outpacing production growth.\nU.S. total annual petroleum and other liquids production is expected to rise 31% between 2011 and 2014 to 13.3 million barrels per day, primarily from tight oil plays.   In the meantime, Chinese production will increase at a much lower rate (5% over this period) and is forecast to be only a third of U.S. production in 2014.\nOn the demand side, China's liquid fuels use is expected to reach more than 11 million barrels per day in 2014, while U.S. demand hovers close to 18.9 million barrels per day, well below the peak U.S. consumption level of 20.8 million barrels per day in 2005.   U.S. refined petroleum product exports increased by more than 173% between 2005 and 2013, lowering total net U.S.  imports of  petroleum and other liquids.\nChina has been diversifying the sources of its crude oil  imports in recent years as a result of robust oil demand growth and recent geopolitical uncertainties. Saudi Arabia continues to be the largest supplier of crude oil to China and in 2013 provided 19% of China's 5.6 million barrels per day.  Because production levels from Iran, Libya, and Sudan and South Sudan dropped since 2011, China replaced the lost shares of crude oil and other liquids imports from these countries with imports from Oman, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Angola, Venezuela, and Russia.\nPrincipal contributor: Candace Dunn\nQuestion:\nIn 2012 what nation is the world's second-largest economy, the largest exporter and second-largest importer?\nAnswer:\n",

Blondie came out of New York City’s punk scene, but they were more tuneful (and pop-minded) and less artsy than most of their contemporaries. From the early-’60s girl-group pop they embraced early on through the disco beats that made them stars to the groundbreaking New Wave/hip-hop fusion of “Rapture,” they rarely stayed in one place. So you’ll find a sample platter of sounds on our list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs.\n10\nQuestion:\nWhat was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?\nAnswer:\n",

Stocks had fallen as much as 4 percent in Athens on Monday morning, before recovering most losses. The stock market was down 1.6 percent in early afternoon trading.\nSyriza won 36.3 per cent of the vote in Sunday's early general elections but fell two seats short of the necessary majority in the 300-seat parliament to form a government on its own.\n'It's like we've been born again and finally feel some hope.'\n— Litsa Zarkada, fired government cleaning worker\nGreece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras speaks to reporter before taking a secular oath at the Presidential Palace in Athens on Jan. 26, 2015. The 40-year-old radical left leader is the youngest man to hold the post in 150 years. (Petros Giannakouris/Associated Press)\nThe details of who will serve in the government and whether the two parties will form a coalition or whether there will be a Syriza-only minority government supported by Independent Greeks were expected to be announced later Monday.\nTsipras has promised to renegotiate Greece's massive bailout agreements, but has vowed not to take any unilateral action against lenders from other eurozone countries.\nTsipras' choice to negotiate with the nationalist Independent Greeks — a party aligned in Europe with the UK Independence Party — rather than the centrist Potami caused concern that he could take a tough line in negotiations with rescue lenders.\nPotami Leader Stavros Theodorakis described the Independent Greeks as \"far right and anti-European.\"\nSyriza's financial planning official, Giorgos Stathakis, confirmed Monday that the new government had no plans to meet with negotiators from the \"troika\" of the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund and would instead seek talks directly with governments.\n'The Greek people have written history'\nGreek voters swung to the once-marginal left-wing party after five years of punishing austerity measures demanded under €240 billion (about $336 billion Cdn) bailout deals threw hundreds of thousands of people out of work and left nearly a third of the country without state health insurance.\nThousands of supporters turned out to watch the 40-year-old Tsipras speak in central Athens after his opponents conceded.\n\"The Greek people have written history,\" he said, to cheers. \"Greece is leaving behind catastrophic austerity, fear and autocratic government.\"\nOutside the party's campaign tent in central Athens, supporters hugged each other and danced in celebration.\n\"It's like we've been born again and finally feel some hope,\" said Litsa Zarkada, a fired government cleaning worker. \"We were thrown into the street just before we could take our pension. We have been through so much.\"\nThe new government faces an immediate cash shortage, with a dwindling primary surplus, upcoming loan repayments, and limits on the money it can raise using treasury bill auctions.\nMegan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said the government will be unable to afford to run its day-to-day operations and pay back debt that falls due in March in the absence of additional cash from international creditors.\n\"Syriza and its creditors are stuck in a Gordian Knot, and both sides will need to cave on something. Neither Greece nor its creditors want Greece to default or exit the eurozone, so a compromise will probably be found,\" Greene told the Associated Press.\nThe new alliance, she said, \"suggests the new government will engage in dangerous brinkmanship with Greece's creditors as it tries to negotiate funding to stave off utter bankruptcy over the next few months.\"\nReport Typo or Error Send Feedback\nTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Since late March 2012 he has been the Respect Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Bradford West.\nAfter first becoming known in Scottish politics, he became General Secretary of the London-based charity War on Want in 1983, remaining in the post until 1987. Galloway was elected in that year's general election as a Labour Party MP representing Glasgow Hillhead. From 1997, Galloway represented its successor constituency Glasgow Kelvin, and remained as the MP for the seat until 2005. In October 2003, Galloway was expelled from Labour, having been found guilty of four charges of bringing the party into disrepute.\nHe became a member of the Respect Party in 2004 (eventually its leader), and was elected as the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow at the general election the following year. After unsuccessfully contesting the seat of Poplar and Limehouse in 2010, he returned as a Westminster MP following the Bradford West by-election in March 2012.\nEarly in his career Galloway was an opponent of Saddam Hussein, but changed his opinion of the Iraqi leader when it became Western policy not to support him. Galloway visited Iraq in 1994 and delivered a speech to Saddam Hussein. which ended in English with the statement: \"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.\" He has maintained that he was addressing the Iraqi people in the speech. Galloway testified to the United States Senate in 2005 over alleged illicit payments from the United Nations' Oil for Food Program.\nGalloway is a campaigner who supports the Palestinian side of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, taking an anti-Zionist stance, and was involved in the Viva Palestina aid convoys. Galloway abruptly withdrew from a debate at Oxford University in 2013, after he discovered the other speaker had joint British-Israeli citizenship.\nGalloway was described by Tom Happold of The Guardian in 2005 as being \"renowned for his colourful rhetoric and combative debating style.\" The Spectator awarded him Debater of the Year in 2001.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of George Galloway's political party?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nHoy (boat)\nA hoy was a  small sloop-rigged coasting ship or  a heavy barge used for freight, usually with a burthen of about 60 tons (bm).  The word derives from the  Middle Dutch hoey. In 1495, one of the Paston Letters included the phrase, An hoye of Dorderycht (a hoy of Dordrecht), in such a way as to indicate that such contact was then no more than mildly unusual. The English term was first used on the Dutch Heude-ships that entered service with the British Royal Navy.\n\nEvolution and use\n\nOver time the hoy evolved in terms of its design and use. In the fifteenth century a hoy might be a small spritsail-rigged warship like a cromster. Like the earlier forms of the French chaloupe, it could be a heavy and unseaworthy harbour boat or a small coastal sailing vessel (latterly, the chaloupe was a pulling cutter – nowadays motorized). By the 18th and 19th Century hoys were sloop-rigged and the mainsail could be fitted with or without a boom. English hoys tended to be single-masted, whereas Dutch hoys had two masts.\nPrincipally, and more so latterly, the hoy was a passenger or cargo boat. For the English, a hoy was a ship working in the Thames Estuary and southern North Sea in the manner of the Thames sailing barge of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the Netherlands a slightly different vessel did the same sort of work in similar waters. Before the development of steam engines, the passage of boats in places like the Thames estuary and the estuaries of the Netherlands, required the skillful use of tides as much as of the wind.\n\nHoys also would carry cargo or passengers to the larger ships anchored in the Thames. The British East India Company used hoys as lighters for larger ships that could not travel up the Thames to London. These were commonly referred to as East India hoys.\n\nIn the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English hoys plied a trade between London and the north Kent coast that enabled middle class Londoners to escape the city for the more rural air of Margate, for example. Others sailed between London and Southampton. These were known as Margate or Southampton hoys and one could hail them from the shore to pick up goods and passengers.\n\nThe introduction of the early steamers greatly expanded this sort of trade. At the same time, barges were taking over the cargo coasting trade on the short routes. Together, these developments meant that hoys fell out of use.\n\nRoyal Navy\n\n \nThe British Royal Navy used hoys that were specially built to carry fresh water, gunpowder or ballast. Some were employed in such tasks as laying buoys or survey work, while others served to escort coastal convoys. Still others were in the Revenue service.\n\nIn 1793–94 the Royal Navy purchased 19 Dutch hoys as coastal gun-vessels, particularly for service under Admiral Sir Sidney Smith. In naval service these had 30-man crews and each carried one 24-pounder gun and three 32-pounder carronades. Examples include  and  (Sharks crew mutinied in 1795 and handed her over to the French). Around the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Navy sold its remaining armed hoys.\n\nConcern about a possible French invasion led the Royal Navy on 28 September 1804 to arm 16 hoys at Margate for the defense of the coast. One of these bore the name King George. The Navy manned each hoy with a captain and nine men from the Sea Fencibles.  The same concern also led the British to build over a hundred Martello towers along the British and Irish coasts.\n\nBecause most hoys were merchantmen, they were also frequently taken as prizes during time of war. Many of the hoys in British naval service had been captured from enemies. One of the earliest on record was the , captured in 1522 and listed until 1525.\nQuestion:\nA traditional hoy boat is powered by?\nAnswer:\n",

It was described by the Kololo tribe living in the area in the 1800’s as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’ – ‘The Smoke that Thunders’. In more modern terms Victoria Falls is known as the greatest curtain of falling water in the world.\nColumns of spray can be seen from miles away as, at the height of the rainy season, more than five hundred million cubic meters of water per minute plummet over the edge, over a width of nearly two kilometers, into a gorge over one hundred meters below.\nThe wide, basalt cliff over which the falls thunder, transforms the Zambezi from a placid river into a ferocious torrent cutting through a series of dramatic gorges.\nFacing the Falls is another sheer wall of basalt, rising to the same height, and capped by mist-soaked rain forest. A path along the edge of the forest provides the visitor prepared to brave the tremendous spray, with an unparalleled series of views of the Falls.\nOne special vantage point is across the Knife-edge Bridge, where visitors can have the finest view of the Eastern Cataract and the Main Falls as well as the Boiling Pot, where the river turns and heads down the Batoka Gorge. Other vantage points include the Falls Bridge , Devils Pool and the Lookout Tree, both of which command panoramic views across the Main Falls.\n*As of December 2016, the KAZA visa for entry into both Zimbabwe and Zambia is available at all major ports of entry into both countries, making it easier than ever to experience both sides of the falls.

Canadian Grand Prix, Rd 16, Montreal, Canada, 8 October 1978.\nIn the 1960s the rivalry between French and English speaking Canada meant that the country's Grand Prix had two homes: Mosport Park one year and Mont-Tremblant the next. By 1970, however, Mont-Tremblant was deemed too dangerous and the race moved full time to Mosport Park.\nIn 1977 the French Canadians, motivated by the incredible success of Gilles Villeneuve, decided it was about time they built a race track. Building a new circuit simply wasn't feasible, however, as time and money were against them.\nTheir solution was simple and effective. Taking the Ile Notre-Dame, they connected all the island's roads and made a circuit. The island had been the home of the 1967 World Fair (Expo'67) and was full of futuristic looking buildings. It was, everyone agreed, a perfect venue for a Grand Prix.\nAfter $2m was spent on upgrading the circuit to Formula One standards, the first race was held there in October 1978. Gilles Villeneuve, in his first season with Ferrari, was yet to win a Formula One race, but at his home Grand Prix he took a memorable debut victory. Following his tragic death in 1982, the track was renamed in his honour.\nHis son, Jacques, never won at the track but some of the great drivers of the sport have taken the spoils here. Michael Schumacher holds the record of having won seven times in Canada. It is also the scene of Jean Alesi's single Grand Prix victory in 1995, driving the number 27 Ferrari, the same car number which carried Gilles Villeneuve into the hearts of the Canadian Formula One fans.\nQuestion:\nThe Gilles Villeneuve Formula One racing circuit is in which country?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nHuarache (shoe)\nHuaraches (derived from Warachi, in Purépecha, indigenous language  , singular huarache) are a type of Mexican sandal. Pre-Columbian in origin.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-Columbian in origin, the sandals are believed related to the cactle or cactli, of Náhuatl origin. The name \"Huarache\" is derived from the Purépecha language term kwarachi, and directly translates into English as sandal. \n\nEarly forms have been found in and traced to the countryside farming communities of Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato and Yucatan. Originally of all-leather construction, the thong structure around the main foot is still traditionally made with hand-woven braided leather straps. \n\nAfter originating in the peasant communities, they were adopted by some religious orders, such as the Franciscan friars. In the 1930s, wider variations began to appear, with soles derived from used rubber car tires—hence the modern \"tread\" form of sole. After the Second World War, veterans started to travel deeper into Mexico; they gained popularity in North America thanks to their adoption as part of the 1960s hippie lifestyle. By the end of the 20th century they were to be found all over North and South America.\n\nStyles\n\nTraditional huarache designs vary greatly, but are always very simple. Originally made of all-leather, later early designs included woven string soles and occasionally thin wooden soles. Later more elaborate upper designs were created by saddlers and leather workers.\n\nThe modern huarache developed from the adoption in the 1930s of rubber soles developed from used rubber car-tires. Modern designs vary in style from a simplistic sandal to a more complex shoe, using both traditional leather as well as more modern synthetic materials.\n\nMany shoes claim to be huaraches, but they are still traditionally only considered a huarache if they are handmade, and have a woven-leather form in the upper.\n\nMedia\n\nHuaraches are mentioned in the lyrics of the Beach Boys songs \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" and \"Noble Surfer\"; and in the novel Ask the Dust, written by John Fante (the Camilla Lopez's shoes) also in the novel On the Road, written by Jack Kerouac. Skeeter Phelan wears a pair of the shoes, which her traditionalist Southern mother hates, in the Kathryn Stockett novel The Help. Doc Sportello, the detective from Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice, wears a pair of huaraches. He eventually loses one shoe and finishes the adventure using only the other one.\nQuestion:\nOriginating in early central American culture, where on the body would a huarache be worn?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nMatthew Webb\nCaptain Matthew Webb (19 January 1848 – 24 July 1883) was the first recorded person to swim the English Channel without the use of artificial aids for sport purpose. On 25 August 1875, Webb swam from Dover to Calais in fewer than 22 hours.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nWebb was born at Dawley in Shropshire, one of twelve children of a Coalbrookdale doctor. He acquired his ability to swim in the River Severn at Coalbrookdale. In 1860 at the age of twelve he joined the training ship HMS Conway for two years then entered the merchant navy and served a three-year apprenticeship with Rathbone Brothers of Liverpool.\n\nWhilst serving as second mate on the Cunard Line ship Russia, travelling from New York to Liverpool, he attempted to rescue a man overboard by diving into the sea in the mid-Atlantic. The man was never found, but Webb's daring won him an award of £100 and the Stanhope Medal, and made him a hero of the British press.\n\nIn the summer of 1863, while at home, he rescued his 12-year-old brother Thomas from drowning in the Severn near Ironbridge.\n\nEnglish Channel swimming record\n\nIn 1873, Webb was serving as captain of the steamship Emerald when he read an account of the failed attempt by J. B. Johnson to swim the English Channel. He became inspired to try himself, and left his job to begin training, first at Lambeth Baths, then in the cold waters of the Thames, the English Channel and Hollingworth Lake. \n\nOn 12 August 1875, he made his first cross-Channel swimming attempt, but strong winds and poor sea conditions forced him to abandon the swim. On 24 August, he began a second swim by diving in from the Admiralty Pier at Dover. Backed by three escort boats and smeared in porpoise oil, he set off into the ebb tide at a steady breaststroke. Despite stings from jellyfish and strong currents off Cap Gris Nez which prevented him from reaching the shore for five hours, finally, after 21 hours and 45 minutes, he landed near Calais—the first successful cross-channel swim. His zig-zag course across the Channel was over 39 miles (64 km) long.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter his record swim, Captain Webb basked in national and international adulation, and followed a career as a professional swimmer. He licensed his name for merchandising such as commemorative pottery, and wrote a book called The Art of Swimming. A brand of matches was named after him. He participated in exhibition swimming matches and stunts such as floating in a tank of water for 128 hours.\n\nOn 27 April 1880, he married Madeline Kate Chaddock, and they had two children, Matthew and Helen.\n\nDeath\n\nHis final stunt was to be a dangerous swim through the Whirlpool Rapids on the Niagara River below Niagara Falls, a feat many observers considered suicidal. Although Webb failed in an attempt at raising interest in funding the event,  on 24 July 1883, he jumped into the river from a small boat located near the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge and began his swim. Accounts of the time indicate that in all likelihood Webb successfully survived the first part of the swim, but died in the section of the river located near the entrance to the whirlpool.  Webb was interred in Oakwood Cemetery, Niagara Falls, New York. \n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1909, Webb's elder brother Thomas unveiled a memorial in Dawley. On it reads the short inscription: \"Nothing great is easy.\" The memorial was taken away for repair after a lorry collided with it in February 2009. The landmark memorial was returned after full restoration and was hoisted back onto its plinth in High Street in October 2009. A road (Webb Crescent) and Captain Webb School, both in Dawley, are named after the swimmer. A memorial plaque with his portrait was also unveiled in the parish church at Coalbrookdale. Webb House of the Adams' Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire, is named after Webb.\n\nCultural references\n\nJohn Betjeman's poem \"A Shropshire Lad\" (1940) commemorates the death of Captain Webb, portraying his ghost swimming back along the canal to Dawley.  It was set to music by Jim Parker and has been the most requested song on the repertoire of John Kirkpatrick during his entire career. \n\nCaptain Webb's picture on boxes of Bryant and May matches is said have inspired the physical appearance of the Inspector Clouseau character portrayed originally in the Pink Panther films by Peter Sellers. \n\nHe was parodied in Horrible Histories (TV Series) in stupid deaths.\nQuestion:\nMatthew Webb swam the English Channel and then drowned swimming where?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nThe Babe's Last Game | Philadelphia Athletics\nThe Babe’s Last Game | Philadelphia Athletics\nPhiladelphia Athletics\nThe Babe’s Last Game\nBy Bob Warrington\nHollywood has twice portrayed the life of Babe Ruth in major motion pictures. The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.\nA Last Hurrah\nIn 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.\n \nFinal Stop\nAfter leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.\n \nThe Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.\n \nAt the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.\nRich Westcott, in his book, “Philadelphia’s Old Ballparks,” describes what happened after the first inning ended:\n \n“As the inning ended, Ruth tucked his glove in his pocket, turned, and ran to the clubhouse in centerfield. The fans, sensing that the end of a glorious career might have arrived, rose and gave Ruth a standing ovation.”\n \nOn June 2, 1935, Ruth was given his unconditional release by the Boston Braves, and he announced his retirement from baseball.\n \nAlthough it is not recorded in any contemporary histories of the game, one might wonder if Babe Ruth paused just briefly to take one last look around Baker Bowl before entering the clubhouse. You see, it was at this same ballpark 20 years before that Ruth had made his first appearance in a World Series game. Playing then for the Boston Red Sox, he appeared as a pinch hitter in the first game of the 1915 Series. In a similarity touched with irony, Ruth grounded out to the Phillies first baseman, just as he would do 20 years later in his last Major League at-bat in the same ballpark.\n \nThe Occasion Commemorated\nSo, despite Hollywood’s attempts to portray Ruth’s last Major League game in triumphal terms at Forbes Field, it was actually shrouded in pathos at Baker Bowl that the Babe’s fabled career came to an end. The Pennsylvania state historical marker erected for Baker Bowl, which was sponsored by the A’s Society and stands at Broad Street and Huntingdon Avenue, correctly notes that the ballpark was the site of “Babe Ruth’s last Major League game.”\nQuestion:\nFor which team did Babe Ruth blast his last Major League home run?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nKaty Perry - One Direction Wiki - Wikia\nKaty Perry | One Direction Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\n[ show ]\nEarly Life\nKaty Perry was born in Santa Barbara, California in 1984. She has one sister, Angela and one brother, David. Perry was raised in a devout Christian family. She attended Christian schools and camps as a child, often singing at her local church in the choir. In her 2012 docu-film Part Of Me, Perry explained how her devout parents banned many things considered satanic such as pop music, Harry Potter books and even the cereal brand 'Lucky Charms'. She and her sister were not aware of mainstream American pop culture until their teens, when they would start going to friends houses.\nMusical Career\nPerry received her first guitar as a Christmas present at age 13, and soon after began writing songs. She would later perform songs at Christian music festivals and events. Perry left high school at age 15 to pursue a musical career. Her first record label was Red Hill Records, where Perry recorded her debut album, the self titled gospel record, Katy Hudson. Perry moved to Los Angeles at age 17 and, in 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later merged her stage name into Katy Perry, based on her mother's maiden name.\nIn 2004, Perry signed to Java Records, which was closely related to The Island Def Jam Music Group. After Java Records was dropped, Perry's mentor introduced her to Tim Devine from Columbia Records who signed her as a solo artist. Perry wrote and recorded material with a host of pop producers including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler/Anne Previn, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, and Max Martin and Dr. Luke. Unfortunately, Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006. Perry then moved to an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.\nAfter Columbia, Angelica Cob-Baehler, a publicity executive at the label, took Perry's unfinished demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom signed Perry to  Capitol Records  in April 2007. The label arranged for Perry to once again work with Dr. Luke in order to create an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material. Perry and Dr. Luke then co-wrote \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot N Cold\" for her second album One Of The Boys. I Kissed A Girl was a worldwide #1 smash. Perry would go on to release two more albums and sell over 100 million records worldwide. Her third album, Teenage Dream, is only the second album in history to produce five #1 hits, after Michael Jackson's Bad. It is also the first album by a female artist to achieve this. Perry performed at the 2015 Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, alongside Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott. Her performance garnered 118.5 million US viewers, making it the highest rated show in Super Bowl history.\nIn 2016, Perry released a promotional single for the Olympics, called \"Rise\", and continues to work on her fifth album.\nPersonal Life\nPerry dated Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy from 2006 to 2008, and appeared in the band's video for their hit single \"Cupid's Chokehold\".\nPerry met comedian and presenter Russell Brand in 2009, whilst filming a cameo for Get Him To The Greek. They began dating soon after and were married in 2010. Perry's docu-film Part Of Me briefly showcases her marriage to Brand, and shows the strain of constant touring keeping them apart. Toward the end of Perry's world tour, Perry becomes more depressed and distraught, due to her failing marriage. On the night of her highest recorded attendance for one Brazilian concert, Perry appears to have ended her relationship with Brand and is reduced to tears shortly before she is due on stage [1] . In 2011, Brand filed for divorce after 14 months of marriage [2] . He would later claims Perry's mainstream success and reluctance to engage in activism as reasons for his leaving. Perry explains in her docu-film that Brand made her choose between her career and their marriage.\nPerry has since dated musician John Mayer and is currently dating actor Orlando Bloom.\nDiscography\nOne of the Boys (2008)\nTeenage Dream (2010)\nKaty Perry: Part of Me (2012)\nThe Smurfs 2 (2013)\nBrand: A Second Coming (2015)\nKaty Perry: The Prismatic World Tour (2015)\nKaty Perry: Making of the Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show (2015)\nJeremy Scott: The People's Designer (2015)\nZoolander 2 (2016)\nCalifornia Dreams Tour (2011–12)\nThe Prismatic World Tour (2014–15)\nQuestion:\nAmerican singer Katheryn Hudson is better known by what name?\nAnswer:\n",

The company closed its final salary scheme to new members in 2002, but this was not enough to stem rising deficits at the fund due partly to falling share prices and partly to rising long term liabilities and increased longevity.\nAmong the plans to be closed is the Mirror Group fund, which was the victim of former proprietor Robert Maxwell's grab.\nThe scheme has 3,000 active members, and they will now be transferred to a defined-contributions scheme, in which their pension payout is related to the amount they put in, as opposed to a fixed amount related to their salary at the end of their careers. As such, pensions will invariably be less generous than under the previous system.\nPaul Holleran of the National Union of Journalists said: \"The scrapping of the final-salary scheme is the latest in a long line of attacks on staff at Trinity Mirror and serious questions need to be asked and answered about the capability of the senior Trinity\ndirectors.\"\nThe group owns five national newspapers, more than 120 regional titles and over 400 digital products, but has struggled in the face of the recession and a sharp fall in advertising revenues.\nThe Daily Mail's owner Daily Mail and General Trust recently shut its own final salary scheme to new members, and the number of defined benefit schemes throughout the private sector is falling fast.\nThe pair are not the only newspaper groups to be struggling. The Observer – the Sunday newspaper owned by the Guardian Media Group – is set from next week to reduce the number of sections to only four. The Scott Trust, the charity that owns GMG, ruled out shutting the title and replacing it with a Guardian-branded edition.\nIts staff will learn which magazines and sections – and how many full-time staff – will survive this week,\nQuestion:\nWho was the owner of Mirror Group newspapers who misused the pension fund\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nGummo Marx\nMilton \"Gummo\" Marx (October 23, 1892  – April 21, 1977) was an American vaudeville performer and theatrical agent. He was the second youngest of the five Marx Brothers. Born in New York City, he worked with his brothers on the vaudeville circuit, but left acting when he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War I (years before his brothers Chico, Harpo, Groucho and Zeppo began their film career).\n\nLife and career\n\nMarx was born in Manhattan, New York City on October 23, 1893. His parents were Sam Marx (called \"Frenchie\" throughout his life), and his wife, Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from Dornum in East Frisia; and his father was a native of Alsace, and worked as a tailor.   \n\nGummo, who in an interview said he never liked being on stage, left the group and joined the military during World War I. He wasn't sent overseas since the armistice was signed shortly after. Gummo's younger brother Zeppo took his place in the group. Gummo later went into the raincoat business.  After his Army career he joined with his brother Zeppo Marx and operated a theatrical agency.  After that collaboration ended, Gummo represented his brother Groucho Marx and worked on the television show The Life of Riley, which he helped develop. He also represented other on-screen talent and a number of writers. Gummo was well respected as a businessman. He rarely had contracts with those he represented, his philosophy being that, if they liked his work, they would continue to use him, and if not, they would seek representation elsewhere. \n\nGummo was given his nickname because he had a tendency to be sneaky backstage, and creep up on others without them knowing (like a gumshoe). Another explanation cited by biographers and family members is that Milton, being the sickliest of the brothers, often wore rubber overshoes, also called \"gumshoes,\" to protect himself from taking sick in inclement weather.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married Helen von Tilzer on March 16, 1929. Their son, Robert, was born in 1930.\n\nDeath\n\nGummo died on April 21, 1977, at his home in Palm Springs, California, aged 84 from a cerebral hemorrhage. His death was never reported to Groucho, who by that time had become so ill and weak that it was thought the news would be a further detriment to his health. Groucho died four months later.\n\nMarx was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. \n\nFamily members\n\nHis grandsons are actors Gregg Marx, Chris Marx, and actor/producer Brett Marx, who as a child actor appeared as 'Jimmy Feldman' in 1976's comedy film The Bad News Bears.\n\nWhen Richard J. Anobile asked Groucho in The Marx Bros. Scrapbook with which brother he was closest, Groucho replied. \"Gummo. He's a nice man, and that's more than I can say for Zeppo.\"\nQuestion:\nWhat was the last name of brothers Chico, Harpo, Groucho, Zeppo, and Gummo?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nAmaretto\nAmaretto (Italian for \"a little bitter\") is a sweet, almond-flavoured, Italian liqueur associated with Saronno, Italy. Various commercial brands are made from a base of apricot pits, almonds, or both. \n\nAmaretto serves a variety of culinary uses, can be drunk by itself, and is added to other beverages to create several popular mixed drinks, as well as to coffee.\n\nOrigin\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name amaretto originated as a diminutive of the Italian word amaro, meaning \"bitter\", which references the distinctive flavour lent by the mandorla amara (the  bitter almond) or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness is not unpalatable, and sweeteners—and sometimes sweet almonds—enhance the flavour in the final products.  Thus one can interpret the liqueur's name as a description of the taste as \"a little bitter\".\n\nConflation of amaro (\"bitter\") and amore (\"love\") has led to associations with romance.  \n\nOne should not confuse amaretto with amaro, a different family of Italian liqueurs that, while also sweetened, have a stronger bitter flavour deriving from herbs.\n\nLegend\n\nDespite the known history on the introduction and acceptance of almonds into Italian cuisine, newer takes on the meanings and origins have been popularized by the two major brands. Though of sometimes questionable factuality, these tales hold a sentimental place in Saronno culture: \n\nIn 1525, a Saronno church commissioned artist Bernardino Luini, one of Leonardo da Vinci's pupils, to paint their sanctuary with frescoes. As the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Luini needed to depict the Madonna, but was in need of a model. He found his inspiration in a young widowed innkeeper, who became his model and (in most versions) lover. Out of gratitude and affection, the woman wished to give him a gift. Her simple means did not permit much, so she steeped apricot kernels in brandy and presented the resulting concoction to a touched Luini.  \n\nBrands\n\nDisaronno Originale\n\nDisaronno Originale (28% abv) has a characteristic bittersweet almond taste (although it contains no almonds or nuts) and is known for its distinctive appearance. Disaronno has been in commercial production since about 1900. It claims its \"originale\" amaretto's \"secret formula\" is unchanged from 1525,  and claims the Luini tale as its own particular history. Its production remains in Saronno, but the product is sold worldwide.\n\nThe company describes its amaretto as an infusion of \"apricot kernel oil\" with \"absolute alcohol, burnt sugar, and the pure essence of seventeen selected herbs and fruits\". The amber liqueur is presented in a rectangular glass decanter designed by a  craftsman from Murano.\n\nThe product was originally named \"Amaretto di Saronno Originale\" (Original Amaretto from Saronno). It subsequently changed to \"Amaretto Disaronno\", transforming the origin of the product into a more distinctive brand name. Finally, it changed once more to \"Disaronno Originale\"; it has not marketed itself as an \"amaretto\" since 2001.\n\nAccording to the Disaronno website, their amaretto contains no almonds, and is nut-free. Therefore, it is safe for people with nut or related allergies.\n\nLazzaroni Amaretto\n\nLazzaroni Amaretto (24% abv), produced by [https://www.chiostrodisaronno.it/en/c/4-about-us Paolo Lazzaroni & Figli S.p.A.], also presents itself as the first such liqueur. It is based on an infusion of Amaretti di Saronno (macaroons), a process which imparts a \"delicate almond/apricot flavour\". Lazzaroni claim the tale of the young couple blessed by the bishop as the origin of their generations-guarded family recipe, dating it to 1718; the amaretto has been in production since 1851. \n\nOther brands\n\nMany distillers  produce their own brand of amaretto. Among them are Bols, DeKuyper, Hiram Walker, Luxardo,  Mr. Boston,  Paramount, and Phillips.\n\nUsage\n\nAmaretto serves a variety of culinary uses.\n\nCooking\n\n* Amaretto is added to desserts, including ice cream, which enhances the flavour of the dessert with almonds and complements chocolate. Tiramisu, a popular Italian cake, is often flavoured with either real amaretto or alcohol-free amaretto aroma.\n* Savoury recipes which call for it usually focus on meat, such as chicken.\n* A few shots of amaretto can be added to pancake batter for a richer flavour.\n* Amaretto is often added to almondine sauce for fish and vegetables.\n*Amaretto is often added to whipped cream.\n\nBeverages\n\nAmaretto may be served neat (by itself) or on ice. It is often added to other beverages to create several popular mixed drinks. It is also a popular choice of liqueur to add to coffee in the morning.\n\nThe following cocktails highlight Amaretto liqueur as a primary ingredient.\n* French Connection. Ingredients: Amaretto liqueur, Cognac and ice cubes \n* Godfather. Ingredients: Amaretto liqueur, Scotch and ice cubes. \n* Godmother. Ingredients: Amaretto liqueur, Vodka and ice cubes. \n* Godchild. Ingredients: Amaretto liqueur, Cream and ice cubes.\n* Hurricane Jenny.

Shot at Pinewood Studios,this filmed stage version starring Glenn Carter and Rik Mayall captures one of the best scores Andrew Lloyd Webber has ever written and is packed with hit songs including “I Don’t Know How to Love Him”, “Gethesmane” and “Superstar”.\nRemastered Album (2012)\nThe original concept album, remastered in 2012.

On the day Bobbyjo was the subject of a huge gamble that saw him sent off at the short odds of 10/1 with Paul Carberry, the son of the trainer Tommy in the saddle. As coincidence had it, Tommy had been the rider twenty-four years earlier, the last time an Irish trained runner had won the race. \n\nThe victory signalled an upturn in fortunes for Irish trained runners in the decade that followed, though he himself completed the course well beaten when defending his crown in 1999.\n\nBobbyjo broke a knee at Fairyhouse Racecourse in February 2001 and had to be destroyed one month later due to his incurable injuries. In memorial of the horse, a new steeplechase first run at Fairyhouse Racecourse in February 2003 has been named after him.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the surname of the father and son who rode Grand National winners, L'Escargot in 1975 and Bobbyjo in 1999?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nFlemington Racecourse\nFlemington Racecourse is a major horse racing venue located in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  It is most notable for hosting the Melbourne Cup, which is Australia's richest horse race.  The racecourse is situated on low alluvial flats, next to the Maribyrnong River.  The area was first used for horse racing in March 1840.\n\nOverview \n\nThe Flemington Racecourse site comprises 1.27 square kilometres of Crown land.  The course was originally leased to the Victoria Turf Club in 1848, which  merged with the Victoria Jockey Club in 1864 to form the Victoria Racing Club.  The first Melbourne Cup was run in 1861.  In 1871 the Victoria Racing Club Act was passed, giving the VRC legal control over Flemington Racecourse.\n\nThe racecourse is shaped not unlike a pear, and boasts a six-furlong (1,200 m) straight known as 'the Straight Six.'  The track has a circumference of 2,312 metres and a final straight of 450 metres for race distances over 1,200 metres.  Races are run in an anti-clockwise direction.\n\nThe course has a crowd capacity of over 120,000 and contains three grandstands.  The biggest ever attendance was on VRC Derby Day in 2006 when 129,089 people saw Efficient win the VRC Derby.[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/100000-and-more-8212-but-nobodys-counting/2006/11/06/1162661617906.html 100,000 and more — but nobody's counting] The racecourse has undergone a facelift in recent years, with the opening of a new $45 million grandstand in 2000.  It also contains a bronze statue of the famous racehorse Phar Lap, which was donated to the Club as part of Australia's bicentenary celebrations in 1988.  The Hill Stand, built in 1977, houses the artist Harold Freedman's seven panel mural which traces the History of Racing.  The work was commissioned to mark the Australian bicentenary in 1988.\n\nFlemington Racecourse was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 7 November 2006,  announced during the 2006 Melbourne Cup. \n\nThe site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\nFlemington Racecourse today hosts many of Australia's top races, including the Melbourne Cup, VRC Derby, VRC Oaks, MacKinnon Stakes, Newmarket Handicap, Australian Cup and Lightning Stakes.\n\nTransport \n\nThe site has its own railway branch line, which operates on race days, bringing visitors to the adjacent railway station.  Originally, it was serviced by Salt Water River station, before that was demolished in the 1860s and replaced with a station on the present site.  Trains depart from platforms 8 and 9 at Flinders Street Station.\nThe No. 57 tram from the City (Elizabeth and Flinders Streets) stops at the Epsom Road entrance.\n\nCar spaces for the disabled are available and taxi ranks are located adjacent to the main entrances.\nShuttle buses run from Epsom Road to the main turnstiles of the racecourse.\nLift access is available in the Prince of Wales Stand and to the first floor of the Members Stand.\n\nRaces \n\nThe following is a list of Group races which are run at Flemington Racecourse. \n\nKey\n\n* hcp - handicap\n* qlty - quality handicap\n* sw - set weights\n* sw+p - set weights with penalties\n* wfa - Weight for Age\n\nGallery\nQuestion:\nFlemington, Greyville, and Longchamp are associated with what, respectively in Australia, South Africa, and France?\nAnswer:\n",

An instant success, it reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and scaled the Top 5 in other countries such as Germany, France and Australia. Although it achieved only moderate success in the US, peaking at number 25 when released in 1982, it is often regarded today as Wilde's signature song. Her debut album Kim Wilde repeated the success of the single, spawning two further hits in \"Chequered Love\" (Top 5 in the UK, France, Australia and Germany) and the UK-only single \"Water on Glass\". Her follow-up album was 1982's Select, led by the hit singles \"Cambodia\" and \"View From a Bridge\". Both were Number 1 hits in France and reached Top 10 positions in Germany and Australia.

This pretty basin was once a thriving transport hub. Now, traditional narrowboats and elegant black and white iron footbridges sit side-by-side with modern bars and restaurants. Close by is luxury shopping centre the Mailbox, with its stylish clothing shops and cafes. \nAmong the cargos that once travelled on the canal was chocolate crumb to the Cadbury factory. Today, this is Cadbury World, a great day out if you have a sweet tooth.\nChocolate and guillotines\nAt Kings Norton Junction, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal joins under permanently open guillotine gates. Opposite the junction is an attractive toll house with its board showing the charges.\nThe Lickey Hills are pierced by three long tunnels. The canal was realigned to allow the building of the M42. Tardebigge Wharf, with its dry dock, maintenance yard, workers' cottages, and historic warehouse remains the main base for maintenance on the canal, and is a great place to start a walk.  It was here that Tom Rolt met Robert Aickman, which led to the creation of the Inland Waterways Association.\nHistoric meeting\nAll 58 locks are in the second half of the canal, as the canal descends through rural Worcestershire. The Tardebigge lock flight has 30 locks in just over two miles, making it the longest in the country.\nHanbury Hall (National Trust) can easily be reached by a pleasant walk across the fields from Astwood Bottom Lock. Hanbury Junction marks the connection with the Droitwich Junction Canal, linked with the Droitwich Barge Canal and offers a route to the River Severn at Hawford. You might like to take a short walk down the Hanbury Flight, which was rebuilt by volunteers. Hanbury's other claim to fame is that it is said to be the real-life counterpart of Radio 4's Ambridge, home of The Archers.\nAround Bilford, the countryside is left behind as the canal begins to encroach on the city environs. The Commandery was the headquarters of Charles Stuart before the Battle of Worcester in 1651.\nAhead lies Diglis Basins and two wide locks accessing the Severn. Once very busy with commercial traffic, the working boats have long been replaced by pleasure craft. Worcester Cathedral stares down imposingly on travellers entering the river.\nBoating\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal is a justifiably popular cruising route and is now part of both the Avon and Stourport Cruising Rings. With 58 locks in all it is well suited to energetic crews, or those who don't mind taking their time.\nDownload Worcester & Birmingham Canal towpath guidance for cyclists\nThe history\nThe purpose of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal was to give a much shorter link between Birmingham and the river Severn. Against opposition from other canals, it obtained its Act in 1791. Construction started at the Birmingham end but progress was slow. The canal was intended to be broad (for boats up to 14ft wide), which is why the first three tunnels have this width, but shortage of money meant that the section from Tardebigge to Worcester was built only wide enough for narrow boats. It opened throughout in 1815.\nWater supply was a major problem and a source of conflict with connecting canals.  At first the Birmingham Canal and the W&B were physically separated by what was known as Worcester Bar, but in 1815 they agreed a compromise whereby the two canals would be linked by a lock, with the W&B paying a compensation toll for all traffic passing through.\nThe guillotine lock by Kings Norton Junction on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal enabled each canal to preserve its water, regardless of the respective levels.\nExperimental vertical boat lift\nTardebigge top lock is particularly deep because it was the site of a experimental vertical boat lift, which proved not to be robust enough.  After a few months it was replaced by a conventional lock — but as a canal’s water usage is largely determined by its deepest lock, it would have been better if it had been replaced by two locks. \nThe volume of traffic never lived up to expectations, though it improved once the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal opened in 1827. Salt had been found when the canal was being cut at Stoke Prior, and the industry which developed became an important source of traffic.  Worcester gas works and other canalside industries used coal brought by the canal.\nRailway competition\nHowever, from 1841 railway competition took away much of the business and in 1868 losses were so severe that a receiver was appointed. The canal was saved by being bought in 1874 by the Sharpness New Docks Company (which by then owned the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal). Under enterprising management new traffic was sought, and the canal survived until nationalisation in 1948.\nThe last commercial traffics were coal from Cannock to Worcester and chocolate crumb from Worcester to Bourneville, ceasing in 1960 and 1961 respectively.\nQuestion:\nThe English cities of Gloucester and Worcester are on which river?\nAnswer:\n",

    "input": "Passage:\nSaint George and the Dragon (Raphael)\nSt. George and the Dragon is a small cabinet painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, painted between 1504 and 1506, and now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The saint wears the blue garter of the English Order of the Garter, reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael's patron Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, by King Henry VII of England. The first word of the order's motto, \"HONI\" can be made out.  The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke, either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino, Sir Gilbert Talbot, or to Henry himself—recent scholarship suggests the latter. The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose.\n\nThe traditional subject, Saint George and the Dragon, combining chivalry and Christianity, is appropriate for the occasion; like his father, Guidobaldo was a condottiero, or proprietor of a band of mercenary soldiers. In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings, including another St George in the Louvre, and the Vision of a Knight in the National Gallery in London.\n\nProvenance\n\nBy 1627 the painting belonged to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630), and was at Wilton House in Wiltshire. Either the 3rd or 4th earl presented it to King Charles I of England.  After the English Civil War it was sold in one of the sales of the Royal Collection at Somerset House in  London on 19 December 1651.  Soon after it was in France. The painting was later a highlight of the Pierre Crozat collection which was acquired through Diderot's mediation by Catherine II of Russia in 1772. For a century and a half, the panel hung in the Imperial Hermitage Museum. It was one of the most popular paintings in the entire collection of the Tsars. In March 1931 it was part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, and bought by Andrew Mellon, as part of his founding donation to the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. This and other foundational artworks, including paintings by Jan van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, and Titian, helped place the National Gallery among the most significant collections of Renaissance art.\nQuestion:\nThe paintings entitled 'St. George and the Dragon' and 'Madonna with the Fish' are works by which Florentine master?\nAnswer:\n",

Members Sign In\nMarcel Marceau and the end of mime\nBy Kevin Hartnett Globe Correspondent \nAugust 01, 2014\nWikimedia Commons\nIf you’ve heard of any mime artist at all, it’s almost certainly Marcel Marceau, the French actor who performed his character “Bip the Clown” all over the world from 1947 until his death in 2007. Earlier this month on The Paris Review’s website, novelist Mave Fellowes wrote a moving appreciation of Marceau that considered what it means for an art form to essentially be born and die with one person.\nThese days we only really encounter mime in street performances, but its roots are as a high art. Following World War II—during which Marceau was wanted by the Gestapo for helping Jewish youths forge identity cards—Marceau studied at the School of Dramatic Art in Paris under the demanding Etienne Decroux, the inventor of corporeal mime. Students learned 250 positions for the hand and spent three months learning how to walk in place. The goal, Fellowes wrote, was to depict “humanity in the abstract, like the statues of Rodin.”\nAdvertisement\nBut Marceau wanted to show people as they actually lived. To do that, he invented Bip the Clown, a character with a floppy top hat, eyebrows painted halfway up his forehead and, of course, a white face. Over the course of thousands of performances, Marceau mimed Bip “through every possible human scenario,” from marriage and death to train trips and encounters with butterflies.\nIn an interview, Fellowes—author of the novel “Chaplin & Company”—said Marceau was inspired by comic actors from the silent films he’d seen as a kid, men like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.\nGet This Week in Opinion in your inbox:\nGlobe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday.\nSign Up\nThank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n“Bip was a little bit comic, a little bit hopeless, he was like the rest of us,” Fellowes said. “He was a much more accurate, less pretentious express of the human condition, and he made people laugh.”\nMarceau was a global sensation, friends with Michael Jackson (whose moonwalk builds off of Marceau’s techniques), the only celebrity mime has ever produced.\nWe’re used to thinking of art forms as things that evolve, as each generation of artists learns from and responds to the one that came before them. But Fellowes says Marceau was the first and maybe last of his kind. This is partly because mime remains a hard art to figure and most young actors don’t hasten to learn it—“Somehow it’s less impressive or less accessible than circus or ballet,” Fellowes said—but also because after Marceau, there was nowhere left to go.\nAdvertisement\n“I think he took his particular style -- he was the best at it there could ever be,” Fellowes said. “There was no room for further evolution, and no one has yet come up with another version of mime which is as appealing.”\nKevin Hartnett is a writer in South Carolina.

I'm beginning to understand why people go out in different ways.  thanks   any otc advise would be great or maybe a preventive diabetics diet suggestion?\nA. look, this is something you just won't be able to do on your own. as far as i know there isn't any OTC test for diabetes. and even if there is , if you are diabetic - you'll have to see a Dr. and do the test any way, if you are not diabetic- you'll have to see a Dr. and see what the hell do you have. don't neglect your health...\nQ. does flaxseed work for hot flashes.is there anything else that helps? going though menopause without hormones.\nA. There have been some researches lately to see if flaxseed does indeed help with hot flashes. flaxseed was studied because it is a phytoestrogen (plant-based estrogen source). Flaxseed contains lignans and omega-3 fatty acids. The research found that it helped some of the women. You need to crush the flaxseed before you eat it in order to get all the oil out of it. You can try it, it is good for you anyway.\nQuestion:\nHidrosis is the medical term for which bodily function?\nAnswer:\n",
